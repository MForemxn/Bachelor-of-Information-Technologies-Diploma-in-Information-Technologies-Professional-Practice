## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Email relies on protocols like SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 for sending and receiving messages, while [[DNS]] translates domain names into IP addresses for network communication.

## OVERVIEW:
Email is a fundamental internet service that allows users to send and receive messages electronically. It operates using several key protocols: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for sending emails, and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) and Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) for retrieving emails from a server. SMTP handles the transmission of messages between mail servers, while IMAP and POP3 enable users to access their emails from various devices. The Domain Name System ([[DNS]]) is a hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 192.0.2.1), which are used by computers to locate and communicate with each other on [[the internet]]. [[DNS]] servers maintain a distributed [[database]] that ensures efficient and reliable domain name resolution, facilitating seamless internet navigation and email delivery.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Email uses SMTP for sending messages.
2. IMAP and POP3 retrieve emails from servers.
3. SMTP transmits messages between mail servers.
4. IMAP allows access to emails from multiple devices.
5. POP3 downloads emails to a single device.
6. [[DNS]] translates domain names into IP addresses.
7. [[DNS]] servers maintain a distributed [[database]].
8. Ensures efficient and reliable domain name resolution.
9. Facilitates seamless internet navigation.
10. Supports email delivery by resolving mail server addresses.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Email relies on SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 protocols.
2. SMTP handles sending, while IMAP and POP3 manage retrieval.
3. [[DNS]] translates domain names to IP addresses for communication.
4. [[DNS]] servers ensure efficient and reliable name resolution.
5. [[DNS]] and email protocols together enable seamless internet and email functionality.
