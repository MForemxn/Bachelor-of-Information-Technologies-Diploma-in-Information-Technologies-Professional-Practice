## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Primary and [[foreign keys]] are essential [[database]] elements that ensure [[data]] [[integrity]], establish relationships, and optimise [[data]] retrieval and management.

## OVERVIEW:
Primary and [[foreign keys]] are critical components in [[relational database]] design, each serving distinct but complementary roles. A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table, ensuring that no duplicate or null values exist. This key is crucial for efficient [[data]] retrieval, updates, and deletions, and it often serves as a reference point for [[foreign keys]] in other tables. [[Foreign keys]], on the other hand, establish relationships between tables by referencing the primary key of another table. This linkage ensures referential [[integrity]], preventing orphan records and maintaining consistency across the [[database]]. [[Foreign keys]] can also enforce cascading actions, such as updates or deletions, to reflect changes in the parent table within the child table. Together, primary and [[foreign keys]] enhance [[data]] accuracy, simplify complex queries, and support the normalisation [[process]], making them indispensable for effective [[database]] management.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. [[Primary keys]] uniquely identify table records.
2. [[Foreign keys]] link columns between tables.
3. Both ensure [[data]] [[integrity]] and consistency.
4. [[Primary keys]] prevent duplicate and null values.
5. [[Foreign keys]] reference [[primary keys]] in other tables.
6. Facilitate efficient [[data]] retrieval and management.
7. Prevent orphan records in child tables.
8. Support cascading updates and deletions.
9. Essential for [[relational database]] design.
10. Enhance overall [[database]] structure and reliability.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. [[Primary keys]] ensure unique and non-null records.
2. [[Foreign keys]] maintain referential [[integrity]] between tables.
3. Both keys are crucial for [[data]] accuracy and consistency.
4. They simplify complex queries and [[database]] operations.
5. Essential for optimising [[database]] performance and management.
