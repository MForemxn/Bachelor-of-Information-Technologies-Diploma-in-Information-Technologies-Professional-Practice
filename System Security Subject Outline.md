This subject provides a comprehensive understanding of contemporary [[system security]] concepts, strategies, and practical techniques essential for securing [[operating systems]], databases, and servers. You will learn to implement [[security]] measures throughout the design and configuration phases, ensuring robust [[system security]] and privacy. The subject places a strong emphasis on [[system hardening]] mechanisms and prominent [[security]] techniques, which you will apply in hands-on practical sessions. By testing the resilience of hardened systems against various attack vectors, you will gain critical skills in defending against real-world [[cybersecurity]] threats. This subject fosters both theoretical knowledge and practical expertise, preparing you to effectively safeguard corporate computing environments.

### Learning and teaching activities

This subject uses active learning strategies, which involves a combination of lectures, workshops and practical sessions to support a research-inspired learning strategy. It also includes elements of guided self-study learning. Students will be required to [[review]] online materials, pre-readings and research literatures before taking the on-campus workshops. Within workshops, students … For more content click the Read More button below.

This subject uses active learning strategies, which involves a combination of lectures, workshops and practical sessions to support a research-inspired learning strategy. It also includes elements of guided self-study learning.

Students will be required to [[review]] online materials, pre-readings and research literatures before taking the on-campus workshops. Within workshops, students present the current research issues following the standard procedure, and conduct practical lab in [[system security]] independently. In group activities, students engage in intensive discussion and activities on selected topics or projects. In assessment 2, students are grouped into defensive and offensive teams. The offensive team has to choose on a subset of the top ten vulnerabilities listed on OWASP project website, identify these vulnerabilities in systems nominated by the defensive team and document their findings. Defensive team Students will be tested on their ability to harden the system. Both teams verify experimental outcomes and to propose solutions to remedy the identified vulnerabilities.

Students must attend workshop sessions and tutorials to complete the required assessment tasks. [[Feedback]] for assessment tasks will be given to students once the marking is finalised. Students will also receive continued [[feedback]] for their workshops and tutorial exercises on weekly basis. This will be administered by the tutor in the tutorial sessions where the deficiencies in the answers to problems are pointed out to students.
