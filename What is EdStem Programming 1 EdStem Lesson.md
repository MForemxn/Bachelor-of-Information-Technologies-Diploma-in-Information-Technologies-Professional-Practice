## What is Ed?

Ed is the website you are looking at right now. It is an awesome platform for learning how to code. The two main areas you will use are the **discussion board** and the **lessons page**.

  

![discussion logo](https://static.au.edusercontent.com/files/tdfCMDrnZ9v5S1rYSG3ZkNfj)

The **discussion board** is the best place for you to stay informed about the subject, and get [[help]] where you need it.

![lesson logo](https://static.au.edusercontent.com/files/6Qbosxx7hsIam3dwfk7EicrQ)

The **lessons page** is where you will find pretty much all of the subject material including lectures, readings, and coding exercises.

Read on for more information about these parts of Ed, and how to get the most from them.

## How do I use the Ed discussion board?

The Ed discussion board is the best place to go to stay up-to-date about the subject, and to get [[help]] when you need it.

It is pretty intuitive, and works just like any other online forum you are used to. You can find official documentation for how to use it [here](https://edstem.org/au/help/student-discussion), but chances are you will be fine to just jump in. We only ask that you follow these ground rules to ensure it works well for everyone.

- **Be respectful.** There is an option to post anonymously, but you should know that this only makes you anonymous to other students. Teaching staff can always see who posted every message.
    

If you are using the board to get [[help]]:

- **Do a quick search before you post**. If your question has been asked and answered already, you can get the answer immediately from a search rather than waiting for someone to answer it again.
    
- **Make your question public** unless you have a good reason not to. Chances are you aren't the only person with that question, so ask it publicly so others will benefit from the answer. If you feel at all embarrassed for asking the question (you shouldn't) then just make the post anonymous rather than private. The private setting should only be used for topics that are highly sensitive (like requests for special consideration).
    
- **Create a new thread for your question.** Don't reply to existing threads, because it's much harder for teaching staff to keep track of replies, and you risk derailing someone else's thread by pulling it off topic. If your question is new, then create a new thread for it.
    
- **Give a short version of the question as the title of your post.** This will make it easier for other teaching staff and others to find your post and know why they should click on it.
    
- **Do not include any code in your post:** Ed makes it easy for teaching staff to jump into the code you have submitted for any exercise. We can look through the code, run it, and make changes to verify that we know what is going on and what it will take to fix it. Putting the code in your post is a waste of your time and ours. It might also tempt others to try to copy your code, which would be a [very bad thing](https://edstem.org/au/courses/15065/lessons/48799/slides/330845).

## How do I follow the Ed lesson plans?

Almost all of the material for this subject is found in the Ed lessons page. The content on this page is organised so that you should work through it systematically, from the top to the bottom. There are three different types of lessons: _lectures_, _readings_, and _coding exercises_.

## Lectures

Lectures are essential watching, as they will be the main place where key concepts are taught, and where announcements are made. They are streamed live at **9am on Mondays**, but can be rewatched at any time afterwards (the same page works for both livestream and recording).

You should try to watch these lectures _live_ if you can, because they are designed to be interactive. There is a live chat that the lecturer will respond to, and the lecturer will adapt if people need things to be explained in a different way.

## Readings

Readings go through the theory and examples of each concept we cover in detail. You should complete the readings before the lab (the lessons are in a linear order, so read everything up to that week's lab). While the lecture aims to give a coherent presentation of the topics, there are many technical aspects that cannot be conveyed in detail (and have the lecture be less than 6 hours long). These aspects will also require reinforcement - you will need to refer to the readings repeatedly to [[help]] this process.

## Coding Exercises

Coding Exercises are the practical application of the material covered in the lecture and in the readings. This is the sharp end of your learning. There are interactive coding exercises scattered through the readings, but the main components are in the Lab lessons. You have a lab each week, which has a lesson of practice exercises, and a lesson of assessment exercises (usually a just a single exercise tying that week's material together).

## Putting these together

You should use the material together to support your learning. Although the material is presented in the order we will introduce it, you should be moving backwards and forwards in the material:

- Watch the lecture (live if possible)
    
- Read the reading material and play with the examples
    
- Attempt the associated lab exercises
    
    - Find where you're stuck, what you don't understand
        
    - Review the material on that topic
        
    - Try again
        
- Come to the lab and ask questions, get [[help]], advice (and meet other people)
    
- Complete the assessment tasks
## How do I complete the Ed exercises?

The coding exercises are the heart of this subject. They are where you put your learning into practice, and actually write, debug and run code.

## What kinds of exercises are there?

The coding exercises come in three flavours.

- **Practice lab exercises:** these exercises are not assessed, and are purely there to [[help]] you learn. You'll work through these exercises during the labs, but you are also welcome to tackle them in your own time.
    
- **Assessed lab exercises:** these exercises are assessed, and correspond to Assessment Task 1 in your subject outline and in Canvas. They will work in exactly the same way as the practice labs, but this time your grade depends on how many of these you successfully complete.
    
- **Assignment exercises:** these exercises are also assessed, and correspond to Assessment Task 2 in your subject outline and in Canvas. They will work in a similar way as the previous exercises, but will involve much broader tasks. It will be less about [[editing]] and correcting existing code, and more about writing code for yourself. You will need to structure your code sensibly with appropriate properties, methods and classes that you design for yourself. Think of it like coding with the training wheels off.
    

## How do they work?

In each exercise you will be given a task to achieve, and some incomplete code that you will need to edit in order to achieve this task.

![](https://static.au.edusercontent.com/files/3NGcICl1R5ZQRN4mHbKd8S1X)

At the bottom are two buttons, **Run** and **Mark**.

Clicking the **Run** button allows you to run your code. As you progress to more challenging exercises, your code will do increasingly sophisticated things. Some of the programs you will create will stop and ask questions, and alter how they proceed depending on the input that is provided to them. The run button allows you to observe and interact with your programs as they run, and check that they behave correctly.

Clicking the **Mark** button submits your code to some automated tests. These tests will attempt to compile and run your code. They will make inputs to your running code and analyse the outputs to check whether they satisfy the task that was set. Ed will let you know whether you have passed the tests, and give you specific [[feedback]] and clues if you failed. The next slide will show you what this [[feedback]] looks like.

## What if I mess up?

You don't need to solve each task on your first go. You can click **Mark** as many times as you like, and each time you click it you will get new [[feedback]] about what you need to do to solve the task. You'll get the same grade whether you solve the task on the 1st attempt or the 101st attempt.

If you ever find yourself so stuck and confused that you need to go back to square one, just click the "..." button at the top right of the screen and then select "_Reset to scaffold"_. This will reset the activity to its original [[state]], before you made any changes to it.

## How do I understand the [[feedback]] that Ed gives me?

Whenever you hit **Mark** in an Ed exercise, your code will be submitted to a set of test cases that put it though it's paces. These tests check that your code is able to compile, that the resulting program can run without crashing, and that it does the right thing when it is running.

The [[feedback]] that Ed gives you will look a little different depending on how your code responded to the tests.

## When your program passes all tests

![](https://static.au.edusercontent.com/files/ddIWaYLdUGzBHHlpiYcflbDr)

The figure above shows what you are aiming for, where the overall [[feedback]] says "Passed". If you get [[feedback]] like this, you can safely move on to the next exercise. If the exercise was assessed, you can be confident that you will get full marks for it.

Below the overall [[feedback]], Ed will provide more details about the individual test cases that your code was checked against. In the figure there is only one test case, and the title of the test case "Printed the correct output" will give you an idea of what was being checked in this test. The green tick indicates that the test was passed.

Most exercises will have multiple testcases, and you will need to pass all of them to fully complete the exercise. For the assessed lab exercises (Assessment Task 1), you will only get marks for an exercise if you successfully pass _all_ test cases. For the assignment (Assessment Task 2), you will get marks for each individual test case that you pass.

It will often take multiple attempts to pass all of the test cases. That's completely fine. You can click Mark as many times as you like. If you fail 100 times, but succeed on the 101st time, then you will get full marks. In the figure, it has taken the user 3 attempts to succeed. The tabs at the top of the figure provide access to the [[feedback]] that was provided for these prior attempts.

## When your program fails one or more tests

![](https://static.au.edusercontent.com/files/H9Ha4PgRioA3MjF55ll7lkWf)

The figure above shows you what the [[feedback]] looks like when you fail one or more of the testcases. This time the overall [[feedback]] says "_Not yet_" and the [[feedback]] for the individual testcase is a red "x".

Below that is more specific [[feedback]] about what went wrong. Here Ed compares the output of your program with the output it expected to see. If you want to pass this test, you need to alter your program so that it produces the expected output exactly. And we do mean exactly: a tiny spelling mistake, some incorrect capitalisation, or even an extra space or missing comma is enough to fail a test.

## When your program crashes

![](https://static.au.edusercontent.com/files/2PMOPSE1P71SPff07PHianWH)

The figure above shows what happens if your program crashes in the middle of a test case. Whenever a [[Java]] program crashes, it will print out—with its dying breath—a message where it attempts to explain why it thinks it crashed. These messages are pretty cryptic, and you'll need to do some detective work to figure out what went wrong. We'll teach you how to decode these messages as we work our way through the subject.

## When your code doesn't compile

Your code needs to be compiled before it can run (see the Ed lesson "_A primer on programming_" for more info). If the compiler isn't able to understand your code, then it won't be able to compile it. In this case Ed won't be able to give you test-specific [[feedback]], since there won't be any program for it to test against.

![](https://static.au.edusercontent.com/files/CA1UyOPianLK1dKZCY5u69Mi)

If your code doesn't compile then you will get [[feedback]] like the figure above. Here the overall [[feedback]] says "Errored". Below this is the output of the compiler, which includes one or more error messages that attempt to explain which part(s) of the code are problematic. These messages can also be pretty cryptic, and you'll again need to do some detective work to figure out what went wrong. Again we'll teach you how to decode these messages as we work our way through the subject.

## Local Development Environments (Completely Optional)

# Downloading Compilers/Interpreters and VMs etc.

## [[Java]]

There's two basic choices for a [[Java]] compiler and VM combinations, both packaged together as [[Java]] Development Kits (JDKs): Oracle, and OpenJDK.

I won't bother with the link to the Oracle JDK, because they seem to be trying to make getting hold of it as hostile as possible.

The OpenJDK can be obtained for all platforms here: [https://openjdk.java.net/](https://openjdk.java.net/)

In the subject we'll technically be using OpenJDK version 21, but any version after 14 is sufficient for the subject (but might as well get 20).

Technically there are other JDKs, and you're welcome to try them, but I haven't and can't comment on their quality or completeness.

## [[Python]]

The [[Python]] foundation maintains the main interpreter for [[Python]], currently at version 3.11.6 on Ed (though 3.12 is out and suitable to use for the subject). If you have an older OS, you may be limited in which version you can use, but anything 3.0+ is sufficient for the subject. It can be downloaded here: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)

As with [[Java]], there are other implementations (in fact, a lot more) that serve different purposes, if you want to delve into that, the [[Python]] wiki has [a big list](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonImplementations).

# Code Editors and Integrated Development Environments

To actually write the code, you need some sort of [[editor]] and these days an IDE is de rigeur (although there is a bit of move to lightweight code editors, that then seem to get feature bloat and look like the IDEs...).

Picking the right [[editor]]/IDE is a personal thing and an excellent starting point for pointless arguments, so the ones I'll put here are just some of the more popular/more used (not the same thing), but if they don't work for you, you're not wrong, you just need to find the right one for you.

## [[Java]]

Without discussing their relative merits and flaws, here's two for [[Java]]:

- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)
    
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
    

These are both full featured IDEs, and can be overwhelming for new programmers. They also both come in several versions. In both cases, just go for the simplest one.

## [[Python]]

I am less familiar with [[Python]] IDEs, most [[Python]] I write is small enough that it doesn't need that level of coding support, but PyCharm is well regarded by many (and made by the same company that makes IntelliJ and played a big part in creating Kotlin):

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
    

## Multi-Language

Some IDEs support multiple languages, with the most common being:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)
    

## Other Options

There's hundreds of other options, including variants of the above ones, from straight forward text editors, to complicated text editors, to programming specific editors that aren't fully featured IDEs and beyond.

Programmers of course enjoy getting into trivial arguments about which [[editor]] isbest (though of course, the best [[editor]] is ~~the one that works for you~~ Microsoft Excel)

[XKCD 378](https://xkcd.com/378)

## How do the lab exercises work?

## What are lab exercises?

Lab exercises are short challenges where you are presented with some incomplete code, and instructions for the alterations required to make the code achieve some specific goal. You'll need to edit the code and run it in order to achieve the goal. You can find out more about how these code challenges work in the _Everything you need to know about Ed_ lesson.

There are two types of lab exercises:

- **Practice lab exercises** are not assessed. They aim to give you hands-on experience with coding and to prepare you for the assessed tasks.
    
- **Assessed lab exercises** formally assess whether you have understood the subject material and can apply it effectively.
    

## Where can I find the lab exercises?

On the [Lessons](https://edstem.org/au/courses/15065/lessons) page of course! They are in 3 components: the "Week X Lab", which has the practice exercises for week X, the "Week X Lab Answers", which will be visible **after** the final lab each week and covers solutions to the practice exercises, and the "Week X Lab Assessment", which has the assessed lab exercises for that week.

## When should I complete these lab exercises?

You must complete the assessed lab exercises by **11:55pm of the Monday of the following week** (so the Week 2 Assessment should be completed by the end of Monday Week 3) . You can complete the practice lab exercises at any time, but obviously they will be most useful to you if you complete them prior to attempting the assessed lab exercises each week.

You are free to complete these exercises in your own time, but we recommend completing them during a scheduled lab class, where tutors and peers will be around for [[help]] and moral support.


## How do the lab classes work?

## What happens during a lab class?

Each lab class will run for 1.5 hours, and is split up into two main activities:

1. Working individually and as a group to attempt the practice lab exercises, with prompting and guidance from the tutor.
    
2. Working individually to attempt the assessed lab exercises, with one-on-one [[help]] from the tutor as needed. You can also use this time to get [[help]] with the final assignment.
    

## Do I have to join my scheduled lab class?

No, it's ok to shop around and even attend multiple labs if you are having trouble with a particular topic or exercise.

Conversely it's also totally fine to skip labs altogether. There is nothing stopping you from completing the lab exercises outside of scheduled class time. You can skip labs guilt-free, as long as you are keeping up with the exercises and confident you are understanding the material well.

## What should I do to prepare?

Prior to attending the lab, please ensure you have worked through the associated lessons (i.e. everything preceding the lab's entry in the Ed lesson page). This includes the associated lecture, which you should have either attended live, or watched the recording afterwards.

It would be a good idea to glance through the lab exercises and attempt at least a few of them. That way, you will be able to make the most of your time in class, focusing on the exercises that are giving you the most trouble.

Please **do not** come to the labs expecting your tutor to give you a personalised catch-up on all the material you missed in the last week. This would not be a good use of anyone's time.

## I missed my lab, how can I catch up?

No big deal, just work through the lab exercises on your own. If you get stuck and need [[help]], then just attend literally any other lab, or post a question on Ed. Just make sure you post your questions well ahead of the deadline, as the discussion board will not be checked over the weekend.

We don’t record the labs because they don’t contain any formal teaching content. They are focused exclusively on helping students work through the lab exercises (which are available in Ed) and answering any questions students have.

## When do the lab classes run?

Lab classes start in **Week 2**. Check out the next page for specifics about when, where and who with.

## How do I join the on-campus labs?

Just check the next page for locations, and rock up to the room listed there.

You may wish to bring your own laptop if you are more comfortable using it, but a pc will be provided for you.

## Do I need to install anything?

No, Ed provides everything needed to complete the subject.

However if you're looking at building a local (to your computer) dev. environment, see the slide following the following slide.

## When, where and with whom?

The following are all of the labs that are currently scheduled for this subject. It's ok to shop around between the different labs, and attend more than one if you need extra [[help]] for a particular topic.

## An important warning

Learning to code is tough. Many of the concepts involved will feel unintuitive and difficult to grasp at first. We've done our best to make this subject approachable and achievable to new and aspiring coders, but you should be prepared for a steep learning curve regardless.

As you work your way through this subject, you will almost inevitably get stuck at some point on a tricky exercise. You will probably be tempted to jump on google and find some code that looks like it solves the exercise. Alternatively, you might know someone else in the subject who has already completed the exercise, and you'll be tempted to copy it from them.

No matter how tempted you are to copy and paste code, **don't**.

For one thing, doing so would be to completely miss the point of the exercise. The point of university is to _learn_, and you learn nothing when you don't actual do things yourself. The assessment tasks are really just there as a tool to check whether you have learnt the things you should've (and will **need** to know when you have to do this for real one day). Copying and pasting code that you don't understand doesn't demonstrate or prove anything of value.

For another thing, copying and pasting code constitutes [academic misconduct](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/when-things-go-wrong/student-misconduct)_;_ an offence that the university takes very seriously. Penalties can range from loosing all marks for the assessment task, to failing the subject, to being suspended or dismissed from your course entirely.

## How is copied code detected?

You might have heard about anti-plagarism systems like Turnitin that analyse written reports to check that they are (or are not) original work. They are easy to use, and give teaching staff detailed reports about the specific parts of your reports that appear to be copied, and the sources they were likely copied from.

We have similar tools at our disposal in this subject, but our tools focus on analysing code instead of written reports. Every line of code you submit in any of the assessed activities for this subject will be analysed by these systems, and teaching staff will get detailed summaries about how much of your code does and does not appear to be original.

You might think it would be easy to fool these systems by changing a few variable names, rearranging things a bit, or adding other red herrings to your code. It's not that simple. These systems don't just analyse what the code looks like at the surface level. They analyse how the code actually works, and the underlying approach that was used to solve the problem.

If you copy someone else's code, you will also copy the underlying approach. If any part of that approach is the slightest bit weird or idiosyncratic, your code will be weird and idiosyncratic in exactly the same way no matter what surface-level changes you make. Those idiosyncrasies provide fingerprints that make it easy for teaching staff to confidently identify code that has been copied. You might be able to remove these fingerprints if you knew enough about coding, but if you knew enough to do that you wouldn't have needed to copy the code in the first place.

In short, copied code is very difficult for beginner coders to hide, and very easy for teaching staff to spot.

## How is copied code dealt with?

Copying code is plagiarism, and the university has an official policy and process for how to handle that. You can find the full details [here](https://www.gsu.uts.edu.au/rules/student/schedule-5.html), but the key things to keep in mind are:

- Teaching staff are required to report all incidents of plagiarism to a Responsible Academic Officer (each school has their own RAO). The RAO provides a brief check to ensure any allegation of misconduct is supported by sufficient evidence, and then forwards the allegation to the Governance Support Unit (GSU).
    
- Teaching staff don't make any decisions about how incidents are handled once they are reported. Any decisions are left to a committee that will weigh your case. We will provide evidence, but that's about it. That means that there isn't much point appealing to or arguing with teaching staff. The process is out of our hands once it is initiated.
    
- The process for investigating incidents is a long and painful one. It can drag on for months (perhaps even longer than a year), during which time you won't know whether you have passed the subject or not, or whether you will be able to take any other subject that has [[Programming 1]] as a prerequisite.
    
- The potential penalties are severe. At a minimum, you are likely to receive 0 marks for the assessment task. More severe cases or repeated misconduct can result in being suspended or excluded from the university entirely.
