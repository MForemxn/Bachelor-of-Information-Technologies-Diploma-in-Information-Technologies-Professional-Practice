1. **Using St George EFTPOS with Square POS:** To use Square POS, you generally need to adopt the hardware solutions provided by Square, such as Square Terminal, Square Reader, or Square Register. There's no direct information about the compatibility of a St George EFTPOS terminal with Square's system. The design and functionality of Square's hardware are specifically tailored to integrate smoothly with their software solutions for payment processing and additional POS functionalities​ ([Square](https://squareup.com/au/en/hardware/terminal))​​ ([Financial IT](https://financialit.net/news/payments/square-releases-new-all-one-eftpos-terminal))​.
    
2. **Processing WooCommerce sales through Square or continuing with EWAY:** Square can integrate with WooCommerce, which means you can use Square to process payments for your WooCommerce online store. However, if you prefer to continue using EWAY for processing online payments, this is also feasible. WooCommerce supports multiple payment gateways, and you can keep EWAY as your payment processor while using Square for your physical store transactions. This setup allows for flexibility in choosing different processors for online and offline segments of your business​ ([Square](https://squareup.com/au/en/hardware/terminal))​​ ([Square](https://squareup.com/au/en/payments/eftpos))​.
    

For the most seamless operation and support, you might consider aligning with Square’s hardware and payment processing systems if you decide to use their POS system, as it is optimized for their ecosystem.

Yes, Square allows you to use its POS system while continuing to use other payment processors like EWAY for your WooCommerce online transactions. The integration of Square with WooCommerce is flexible, enabling you to manage online and offline payments effectively. You can choose to process payments through Square for both your physical and online sales or continue using different gateways for each, depending on your business needs.

This setup is supported by Square's integration with WooCommerce, which is designed to synchronize sales, inventory, and customer data across both platforms, providing a cohesive management experience. This means you can maintain EWAY for online transactions while using Square POS for in-store sales without violating Square's terms of service​ ([Square](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/5922-woocommerce-and-square))​​ ([Square](https://squareup.com/us/en/the-bottom-line/selling-anywhere/square-now-integrates-with-woocommerce-to-help-you-streamline-your-omnichannel-business))​​ ([Square](https://squareup.com/help/au/en/article/5922-woocommerce-and-square))​​ ([WooCommerce](https://woo.com/document/woocommerce-square/setup-and-configuration-of-the-woocommerce-square/))​.

Moreover, the WooCommerce Square plugin supports various configurations that allow for such flexibility, including the option to sync or not sync certain data between WooCommerce and Square, based on your specific business requirements​ ([WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-square/))​​ ([OSTraining](https://ostraining.com/blog/wordpress/woocommerce-square/))​.

So, in essence, Square supports a hybrid approach where you can utilize its services for physical sales and another service like EWAY for online transactions, effectively allowing you to tailor the payment processing solutions to fit the unique needs of your business.

The integration of Square with WooCommerce does not restrict you from using other payment gateways like EWAY for online transactions. Square's integration is designed to offer flexibility, allowing you to manage payments both online and offline through different systems if you choose. The system is set up to handle transactions and synchronize data across both platforms, without necessarily requiring all transactions to be processed via Square.

This setup enables you to use Square for in-store transactions while maintaining EWAY or any other payment gateway for your WooCommerce online store. This information is supported by Square's documentation, which focuses on the integration capabilities with WooCommerce, providing flexibility in managing payments and inventory across platforms without specific restrictions on the exclusive use of Square for all transaction processing​ ([Square](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/5922-woocommerce-and-square))​​ ([Square](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/6512-wordpress-and-square))​.
