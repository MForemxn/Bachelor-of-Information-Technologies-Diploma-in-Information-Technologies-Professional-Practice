# Reflection for Comments

I believe the design of my personal website is rather simplistic, as I ensured not to put too much emphasis on images and fonts. Instead, I used simple card-like elements throughout my page in order to add my own touch. As a software designer who has built an iOS application before, I am well aware of the Apple Human Interface Design Specifications, and therefore tried to add as many common elements as possible into my site. 

### Technical Aspects

The structure of the website is simple yet effective, designed to cater to users seeking information about my past, present, and aspirations for the future. HTML5 was used to create the semantic structure, with `<nav>` for navigation, `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` elements to define the content areas. CSS selectors, particularly class selectors (e.g., `.navigation-grid`, `.with-image`), were employed to style specific components of the pages, allowing for a modular and easily maintainable stylesheet. ID selectors were avoided to keep the styling more generic and reusable across multiple elements, promoting a consistent look and feel while minimising the CSS footprint.

CSS Flex box and Grid were pivotal in creating responsive layouts that adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring content is presented in an organised and readable manner regardless of device. The use of relative units (e.g., %, vh) for layout dimensions and font sizes ensures scalability and enhances the responsive design, making the website visually appealing across devices.

### Aesthetics

The aesthetic goal of the site was to craft a clean, minimalist design that focuses on content while providing visual interest through subtle design elements and imagery. The colour scheme is predominantly black and white, with occasional use of grayscale for backgrounds to differentiate different sections without overwhelming users with colour. This choice aims to create a professional yet welcoming atmosphere, inviting users to explore my journey and future aspirations.

Images, where used, is meaningful and relevant to the content, enhancing the narrative without distracting from the information presented. The layout's simplicity, combined with carefully chosen images, serves to draw users' attention to key information and guide them through my story and achievements.

### Accessibility

Accessibility was a key consideration in the website's design, following W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Alt attributes are provided for all images, ensuring that users with screen readers can understand the images' context. The website's structure, marked up with semantic HTML5 elements, enhances its navigability and readability, allowing users, including those with disabilities, to easily navigate and interact with the content.

Colour contrast ratios were considered to ensure text is readable by users with visual impairments. The site's responsive design not only ensures usability across a wide range of devices but also benefits users with mobility impairments who might rely on specific hardware to access the web.
