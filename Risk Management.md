# What is Risk Management in [[Information Security]]?
- risk management in [[information security]] involves identifying, assessing, and taking steps to mitigate risks to an organisation's information assets
- aims to protect the [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], and [[availability]] of data
- involves a continuous process of:
	- risk [[identification]]
	- risk assessment (evaluating the potential impact and likelihood of risks)
	- [[risk mitigation]] (implementing controls to manage risks)
	- monitoring and review (to ensure the effectiveness of the risk management strategy and to adapt to new threats)

# Importance of Risk Management in [[Information Security]]
- critical for maintaining the trust of customers and stakeholders
- helps in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements
- minimises financial losses and protects against data breaches and cyber attacks
- enables organisations to make informed decisions about where to allocate resources for the best protection

# Risk Assessment Techniques
- qualitative risk assessment: uses subjective methods to determine the severity of risks based on their nature and impact
- quantitative risk assessment: employs mathematical formulas to assign numerical values to the likelihood and impact of risks
- hybrid approaches: combine both qualitative and quantitative elements for a more comprehensive analysis

# [[Risk Mitigation]] Strategies
- accepting the risk: deciding that the cost of mitigating the risk outweighs the potential loss
- avoiding the risk: changing plans or strategies to eliminate the risk or its impact
- transferring the risk: using insurance policies or outsourcing to shift the responsibility of the risk to another party
- reducing the risk: implementing [[security]] controls, policies, and procedures to lessen the likelihood or impact of the risk

# Tools and Frameworks for Risk Management
- ISO 27001: an international standard for managing [[information security]]
- NIST SP 800-53: provides a catalog of [[security]] and privacy controls for federal [[information systems]] and organisations
- COBIT: a framework for the governance and management of enterprise IT that supports risk management
- Risk Management Information System (RMIS): software tools designed to support the risk management process

# Challenges in Risk Management
- rapidly evolving cyber threats and technologies make it difficult to stay ahead of risks
- balancing [[security]] measures with usability and business operations
- ensuring comprehensive risk coverage in a complex IT environment
- resource constraints can limit the ability to implement desired [[security]] measures

# Future Trends in Risk Management
- increased reliance on artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict and mitigate risks
- greater integration of risk management into business [[processes]] and [[decision]]-making
- emphasis on building resilience and recovery strategies, not just prevention
- growing importance of third-party risk management as organisations increasingly rely on external vendors and services
