## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
A standard static route is a manually configured network route used to direct [[data]] packets to a specific destination.

## OVERVIEW:
A standard static route is a type of network [[routing]] configuration where a specific path is manually set by a network administrator to direct [[data]] packets from one network to another. Unlike [[dynamic routing]], which automatically adjusts to network changes, [[static routing]] requires manual updates if the network topology changes. Static routes are often used in smaller networks or in scenarios where network paths are predictable and stable. They provide a straightforward method for [[routing]] traffic, ensuring that [[data]] packets follow a predetermined path. This can enhance [[network security]] and performance by reducing the complexity and overhead associated with [[dynamic routing]] protocols. However, static routes lack the [[flexibility]] of [[dynamic routing]], as they do not automatically adapt to network failures or changes. Therefore, they are best suited for simple, stable networks or as a backup in more complex [[routing]] environments.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Static routes are manually configured by network administrators.
2. They direct [[data]] packets to specific network destinations.
3. Ideal for small, stable networks with predictable paths.
4. Provide enhanced [[security]] and performance by reducing complexity.
5. Lack [[flexibility]] compared to [[dynamic routing]] protocols.
6. Do not automatically adapt to network changes or failures.
7. Require manual updates if network topology changes.
8. Useful as a backup in complex [[routing]] environments.
9. Reduce overhead associated with [[dynamic routing]].
10. Best suited for scenarios with stable and predictable network paths.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Static routes require manual configuration and updates.
2. They are ideal for simple, stable network environments.
3. Offer enhanced [[security]] and performance benefits.
4. Lack the adaptability of [[dynamic routing]] protocols.
5. Serve as a reliable backup in complex networks.
