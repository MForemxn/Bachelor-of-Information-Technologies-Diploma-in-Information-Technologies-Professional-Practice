[[Security]] headers are HTTP response headers that, when properly configured, can help enhance the [[security]] of a website by instructing browsers on how to behave when handling the site's content. They are an essential part of web [[security]], helping to mitigate various types of attacks such as [[cross-site scripting (XSS)]], clickjacking, and other code injection attacks.

## Common [[Security]] Headers

### 1. Content-[[Security]]-Policy (CSP)
- **Purpose**: Helps prevent XSS attacks by specifying which dynamic resources are allowed to load.
- **Example**: `Content-[[Security]]-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://apis.example.com`

### 2. X-Content-Type-Options
- **Purpose**: Prevents the browser from interpreting files as a different MIME type than what is specified by the content type in the HTTP headers.
- **Example**: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`

### 3. X-Frame-Options
- **Purpose**: Protects against clickjacking attacks by preventing the websiteâ€™s content from being embedded in other sites.
- **Example**: `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`

### 4. Strict-Transport-[[Security]] (HSTS)
- **Purpose**: Enforces secure (HTTPS) connections to the server.
- **Example**: `Strict-Transport-[[Security]]: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`

### 5. X-XSS-Protection
- **Note**: This header is deprecated and not recommended for use, as modern browsers have built-in protection against XSS.
- **Purpose**: Was used to enable the [[cross-site scripting (XSS)]] filter in the browser.

### 6. Referrer-Policy
- **Purpose**: Controls how much referrer information (the URL of the previous page) is passed along with requests.
- **Example**: `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` or `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

### 7. Feature-Policy (Deprecated) / Permissions-Policy
- **Purpose**: Allows a site to control which features and APIs can be used in the browser.
- **Example**: `Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(self), microphone=()`

## Implementing [[Security]] Headers

- **Server Configuration**: [[Security]] headers are typically added through web server configuration files (e.g., Apache .htaccess, Nginx.conf) or through server-side scripting.
- **Testing Tools**: Tools like Mozilla Observatory, SecurityHeaders.com, or Google Chrome's Lighthouse can analyze a website's headers and suggest improvements.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly review and update [[security]] headers to adapt to new threats and ensure compliance with best practices.

## Conclusion

Implementing [[security]] headers is a straightforward yet effective measure to enhance the [[security]] posture of a website. While not a silver bullet for web [[security]], they play a crucial role in a layered [[security]] strategy. Regularly auditing and updating these headers as part of your [[security]] protocol is essential for maintaining a robust defense against common web vulnerabilities.
