# Subject description

This subject develops students' professional information technology practice skills within the context of a real-life
technology project, through the Engineers Without Borders (EWB) Challenge. Students work in teams to create an
appropriate design solution for a given problem as set out in the EWB Challenge Design Brief. While appreciating the
central role of effective communication and teamwork in IT practice, students develop an understanding of the ethical,
social, cultural, economic and environmental responsibilities of an IT professional. This subject is a starting point
for students' ongoing professional development that they undertake throughout their studies and as an IT professional in
their career.

The skills introduced include understanding and applying principles and theories of human communication; researching the
various discipline areas that inform the development of a design solution; identifying, formulating and designing a
solution to solve a problem while considering ethical and socio-technical issues; written and oral communication for IT
contexts; expressing technology concepts through visual communication; and, leading and participating in team [[processes]].

# Subject learning objectives (SLOs)

Upon successful completion of this subject students should be able to:

1. Demonstrate an awareness of Indigenous Australian cultural, historic, and contemporary contexts in order to inform
   work in a complex project. (A.1)

2. Identify stakeholder needs and ethical considerations through the empathise design stage. (B.1)

3. Apply a design thinking approach to meet stakeholder needs. (C.1)

4. Communicate an evidence-based design solution for an IT or engineering project. (E.1)

5. Explain how different experiences of a diverse team work together to achieve a design solution. (E.1)

# Course intended learning outcomes (CILOs)

This subject also contributes specifically to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (
CILOs):

Indigenous Professional Capability: FEIT graduates are culturally and historically well informed, able to co-design
projects as respectful professionals when working in and with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.

(A.1)

Socially Responsible: FEIT graduates identify, engage, interpret and analyse stakeholder needs and cultural
perspectives, establish priorities and goals, and identify constraints, uncertainties and risks (social, ethical,
cultural, legislative, environmental, economics etc.) to define the system requirements. (B.1)

Design Oriented: FEIT graduates apply problem solving, design and [[decision]]-making methodologies to develop components,
systems and [[processes]] to meet specified requirements. (C.1)

Collaborative and Communicative: FEIT graduates work as an effective member or leader of diverse teams, communicating
effectively and operating within cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural contexts in the workplace.

(E.1)

# Teaching and learning strategies

Each week students are expected to prepare for tutorials by completing a set of online tasks provided on Canvas. The
tasks involve such activities as reading and notetaking, watching a video, completing a quiz, and other online
exercises. Responses to the pre-class tasks are used in online classes to add depth to discussion and are an essential
component to the concepts covered throughout the subject are used in-class to add depth to discussion and are an
essential component to the concepts covered throughout the subject. In addition, students will go through the stages of
writing a project report, culminating in a final report describing their proposal for the EWB project.

During online/ face to face tutorials, students will build on the pre-work to learn new skills. These skills will be
practiced in class and are designed to be relevant to the tasks involved in the EWB challenge team project. Areas of
learning in tutorial classes include problem solving, team building, exploring scenarios with a focus on ethics, project
management, design and build, reflection and group discussion. Activities support acquisition of professional
information technology skills in a small group setting under the supervision of a tutor; these skills relate directly to
your major group EWB project.

**OPELA:** An aim of this subject is to [[help]] you develop academic and professional language and communication skills in
order to succeed at university and in the workplace. To determine your current academic language proficiency, you are
required to complete an online language screening
task, [OPELA](https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/enhancing/language-and-learning/about-opela-students).
If you receive a Basic grade for OPELA, you must attend additional Language Development Tutorials (each week from weeks
3 to 12) in order to pass the subject. The development of these tutorials is a new university-wide initiative designed
to provide personalised support and enhance students’ English language skills. They will focus on developing your
communication skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening) and your independent learning skills, which will [[help]] you
to prepare for the subject assessment tasks and for professional workplace communication tasks.

# Assessment

Assessment tasks in this subject are designed to [[help]] you develop the essential professional skills all professionals
need. Through the application of these skills to the EWB Challenge and its associated assessment tasks, you will develop
a greater understanding of technology, improve your professional skills, and build a "toolbox” of knowledge, techniques,
and [[processes]] you can use in future IT work.

You are encouraged to discuss your assessment tasks with your group, other students in your class, and your tutor,
however, you should not provide a copy of your work to other students or groups nor share it online.

Groups are formed in the week 2 tutorials and students must join a group from their officially timetabled tutorial class
as groups will work on their project in class each week. Absent students will not be allocated to a group outside of
class, students must attend their tutorial to be allocated to a group, Students who miss their week 2 tutorial should
speak to their tutor about joining a team before class starts in week 3 and must be in a group by the end of week 4.

It is an expectation of this subject that you will take ownership of your own learning, conduct yourself professionally
and ethically, and contribute equally to the research, design, development, documentation, and delivery of your group’s
project and assessment tasks. Students are expected to actively engage and communicate with their group throughout the
semester and to proactively discuss issues with their group as they arise.

Self and peer assessment will be conducted throughout the semester to monitor and assess team functioning and individual
contributions to the project and group assessment tasks. Group assessment tasks will be assessed collectively, however,
students will receive an individualised grade which has been moderated by their self and peer assessment results to
reflect individual contributions to each task. Students who do not meet the minimum standard for individual contribution
to group tasks will receive a score of zero for the respective task

In this subject, , students are permitted to use [[AI]] technologies in an ethical and transparent manner to generate
materials for background research and self-study. Only assistive use is permitted. Content generated by [[AI]] technologies
or other sources presented as your own work is considered to be academic misconduct as per
the [UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/rules/uts-student-rules/section-16) [Student Rules on misconduct](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/rules/uts-student-rules/section-16).
Students may be asked to participate in a viva voce assessment to confirm or clarify your work and/or marks.

1. Any use of generative [[AI]] tools must be acknowledged by citing their use through referencing in students’ work

2. Students must provide all interactions with the generative [[AI]] tool, including prompts and responses, as an Appendix
to submitted work (including assessments)

It is students responsibility to check and verify the accuracy and integrity of the information used and to rewrite any
text provided by [[AI]] or other sources in their own words.

For further information on the moderation of grades and the minimum requirements for this subject please refer to the
Moderation of Grades and Minimum Requirements sections later in this outline.

The subsections below summarise the assessment tasks for this subject. Detailed information and requirements for each
assessment task will be posted on Canvas throughout the semester and students should refer to Canvas for these details.

| **Task:**         | In teams, students will investigate a design brief provided by Engineers Without Borders and select a problem opportunity to develop a design solution for. Throughout the subject teams will engage with the design thinking process to develop their design. Teams will be provided formative experiences to share their progress throughout the subject and develop a final report and presentation to communicate their process and design. As part of the process of developing the project, teams will bring a draft of early sections of their report to class, participate in peer review exercises and submit a small reflection responding to the [[feedback]]. This process will assist in improving your work and inform changes to the project to work on throughout the rest of the semester. |

| **Further Information** | This assessment is moderated by Self and Peer Assessment to determine individual grades. Students who do not meet the minimum standard for individual contribution to both assessment task 2 AND 3 will receive a score of zero for BOTH tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This assessment will be assessed for academic language proficiency. Students will be directed to further language
support if your language is below the required standard.

# Moderation of marks

Where assessment items are marked by more than one marker, moderation will occur in line with UTS policy.

Individual grades for group assessment tasks are moderated by self and peer assessment to determine fair grades based on
individual contributions to the tasks. Students who do not meet the minimum standard for individual contribution to
group tasks will receive a score of zero for the respective task.

Students are expected to participate professionally and truthfully in self and peer assessment. Students who do not
participate in self and peer assessment forfeit their right to appeal their ratings. Students found to have acted
dishonestly or inappropriately in the self and peer assessment may have their ratings and comments excluded from the
calculations and/or may be referred to the faculty for misconduct.

At the discretion of the subject coordinator students may be asked to show evidence of drafting of their work, evidence
of their team contributions, and/or asked to participate in a Viva Voce presentation of their work to determine an
appropriate grade for an assessment task.

# Assessment [[feedback]]

Assessments are designed to be progressive, where students will receive [[feedback]] to build and improve their work for
subsequent assessments.

Students will receive regular [[feedback]] in class from their tutor on their work, their group project, and their progress
in the subject. In addition, students will participate in tutorial activities and formal peer reviews to give and
receive [[feedback]] from their peers.

Formal written [[feedback]] on assessment tasks will be provided on Canvas.

# Minimum requirements

In order to pass the subject, a student must achieve an overall mark of 50% or more.

Students are required to participate in the team forming activities in the Week 2 tutorial and self-allocate to a team
by the end of Week 4. As
per [UTS Student Rule 3.8](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/rules/uts-student-rules/section-3#r3.8), Students
who are not in a team by the end of Week 4 may be refused permission to attempt Assessment Tasks 2 and 3 and a fail will
be recorded for the subject.

Assessment Tasks 2 and 3 are based on the same project work and thus present the same project in alternate ways,
therefore, students are expected to significantly contribute to BOTH tasks. As it is unreasonable to present work that
you did not contribute to students who do not meet the minimum standard for individual contribution to the project
and/or Assessment Task 2 will be refused permission to attempt Assessment Task 3. As
per [UTS Student Rule 3.8](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/rules/uts-student-rules/section-3#r3.8) a fail
will be recorded for both tasks and the subject.

It is a requirement of this subject that all students complete OPELA. Students who received a Basic grade in the OPELA
test are required to attend 80% of the Language Development Tutorials in order to pass the subject. Please see
the [UTS Student Rules Section 3.8](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/rules/uts-student-rules/section-3#r3.8).
Students who do not complete these requirements will have their grade withheld until such time as they complete them.

# Assessment: faculty procedures and advice

**Marking criteria**

Marking criteria for each assessment task will be available on the Learning Management
System: [Canvas](https://canvas.uts.edu.au/).

## Extensions

When, due to extenuating circumstances, you are unable to submit or present an assessment task on time, please contact
your subject coordinator before the assessment task is due to discuss an extension. Extensions may be granted up to a
maximum of 5 days (120 hours) for standard students or up to a maximum of 7 days (168 hours)
for [UTS Online students](https://www.uts.edu.au/utsonline-extension-form). In all cases you should have extensions
confirmed in writing.

## Special consideration

If you believe your performance in an assessment item or exam has been adversely affected by circumstances beyond your
control, such as a serious illness, loss or bereavement, hardship, trauma, or exceptional employment demands, you may be
eligible to apply
for [Special Consideration](http://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/managing-your-course/classes-and-assessment/special-circumstances/special).

## Late penalty

For Graded [[subjects]]:

Work submitted late without an approved extension is subject to a late penalty of 10 per cent of the total available
marks deducted per calendar day that the assessment is overdue (e.g. if an assignment is out of 40 marks, and is
submitted (up to) 24 hours after the deadline without an extension, the student will have four marks deducted from their
awarded mark). Work submitted after five calendar days is not accepted and a mark of zero is awarded.

For some assessment tasks a late penalty may not be appropriate – these are clearly indicated in the subject outline.
Such assessments receive a mark of zero if not completed by/on the specified date. Examples include:

a. weekly online tests or laboratory work worth a small proportion of the subject mark, or

b. online quizzes where answers are released to students on completion, or

c. professional assessment tasks, where the intention is to create an authentic assessment that has an absolute
submission date, or

d. take-[[home]] papers that are assessed during a defined time period, or

e. pass/fail assessment tasks.

For Pass/Fail [[subjects]]:

Work submitted late without an approved extension will only be assessed at the subject coordinator’s discretion.
Students who do not submit assessment tasks by the due dates may be referred to the Responsible Academic Officer
under [Student Rule 3.8.2](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/rules/uts-student-rules/section-3), and a fail
result may be recorded for the subject.

Request a review of a result

If you believe an error may have been made in the calculation of your result in an assessment task or the final result
for the subject, it is possible
to [request a review of a result](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/managing-your-course/classes-and-assessment/results/request-review-result)
with the Subject Coordinator within five (5) working days of the date of release of the result.

# [[Academic integrity]]

[[Academic integrity]] is about demonstrating honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility in your studies and
assessments. Studying at UTS and being part of our community means maintaining these values and acting with academic
integrity at all times. This is in line with expectations for professional practice
in [Engineering](https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/sites/default/files/2022-08/code-ethics-guidelines-professional-conduct-2022.pdf)
and [IT](https://www.acs.org.au/content/dam/acs/CodeOfProfessionalEthics_Mar_2023.pdf).

## Guide to practising [[academic integrity]]

As a UTS student, when you create something original, credit others and collaborate with care, you act with academic
integrity:

Create something original. This means doing all your own work from start to finish, submitting work that is original for
that assessment and being honest about any data or results.

Credit others. You need to acknowledge and reference the source of any ideas, data or materials you use or adapt in your
work.

Collaborate with care. Make sure you do group work according to the guidelines from your tutor, lecturer or supervisor,
study with your classmates and friends with care and keep your assessment and study notes just for you.

If you are feeling confused about [[academic integrity]], it’s okay, just ask! We’re here to [[help]] you understand academic
integrity and do your assessments with confidence:

or [UTS [[help]] services](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/academic-support/academic-integrity/academic-help)
if you’re unsure about anything [[academic integrity]] related.

## Generative [[AI]] (GenAI) and [[academic integrity]]

In Faculty of Engineering and IT [[subjects]], unless otherwise instructed by the Subject Coordinator, you are permitted to
use [[AI]] technologies, such as ChatGPT or DALL-E, to generate materials for background research and self-study. Only
assistive use is permitted. Content generated by [[AI]] technologies or other sources presented as your own work is
considered to be academic misconduct as per
the [UTS Student Rules on misconduct](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/rules/uts-student-rules/section-16).

There are a few things you must do to ensure you are maintaining [[academic integrity]]:

Check the rules for if and how you can use GenAI in your [[subjects]] and assessments via this subject outline or your
subject sites in Canvas (rules will differ between [[subjects]], so make sure you check each subject). If you are not sure,
check with your tutor, lecturer or subject coordinator.

Understand [how to use GenAI ethically](https://studyguides.lib.uts.edu.au/genai/home).

Unless instructed otherwise by the Subject
Coordinator, [reference and acknowledge](https://studyguides.lib.uts.edu.au/genai/referencing) the use of GenAI in your
work, providing details of the type of interactions and extent of usage.

## [[Academic integrity]] breaches

A breach of [[academic integrity]] is also known as 'academic misconduct'. A breach occurs if you engage in behaviour that
undermines [[academic integrity]], such as plagiarism and cheating (
see [Student Rule 16.2](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/rules/uts-student-rules/section-16)).

Plagiarism can take a number of forms including but not limited to:

copying any section of text, no matter how brief, from a book, journal, article or other written source, such as coding,
without duly acknowledging the source. copying any map, diagram, table or figure without duly acknowledging the source.
paraphrasing or otherwise using the ideas of another author without duly acknowledging the source. re-using sections of
verbatim text without using quote marks to indicate the text was copied from the source (even if a reference is given).

Cheating includes, but is not limited to:

submitting work that is not your own, copying from another student, recycling another student's work, recycling
previously submitted work, and working with another student in the same cohort in a manner that exceeds the boundaries
of legitimate cooperation purchasing an assignment from a website and submitting it as original work. requesting or
paying someone else to write original work, such as an assignment, essay or computer program, and submitting it as
original work. manipulating an assessment to avoid the UTS detection software or using of a third-party service to
bypass the UTS detection software. using material or equipment that is not specified on an examination paper for use in
the examination.

Students who allow their assessment to be copied, share their assessment on external platforms, or provide other
students with the answers to assessments are also subject to student misconduct Rules.

These are all serious forms of misconduct
and [penalties apply](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/academic-support/academic-integrity/consequences-plagiarism-and-cheating).

To [[help]] ensure [[academic integrity]], assessments that you submit electronically may be subject to similarity detection
software. Your work must be submitted in a format able to be assessed by the software (e.g. doc, pdf ([[text files]]), rtf,
html). Under
the [Coursework Assessments Policy](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/policies/uts-policy/coursework-assessments-policy) (
section 4.27), vivas or other invigilated tasks may be used to confirm or clarify your work and/or marks, and to verify
achievement of learning outcomes.

# Academic liaison officer

[Academic liaison officers](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/students-with-accessibility-requirements/accessibility-service/services-and-assistance/academic-liaison-officers-alos/alo-list) (
ALOs) are academic staff in each faculty who assist students experiencing difficulties in their studies due to:
disability and/or an ongoing health condition; carer responsibilities (e.g. being a primary carer for small children or
a family member with a disability); and pregnancy.

ALOs are responsible for approving adjustments to assessment arrangements for students in these categories. Students who
require adjustments due to disability and/or an ongoing health condition are requested to discuss their situation with
an accessibility consultant at
the [Accessibility Service](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/students-with-accessibility-requirements/accessibility-service)
before speaking to the relevant ALO.
