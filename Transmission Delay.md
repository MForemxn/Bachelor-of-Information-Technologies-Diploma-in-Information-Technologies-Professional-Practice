## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Transmission delay is the time required to push all the bits of a [[data]] packet onto the network link from a network node.

## OVERVIEW:
Transmission delay, also known as store-and-forward delay, is a key component of network latency, representing the time it takes for a network node, such as a router or switch, to transmit all the bits of a [[data]] packet onto the network link. This delay is determined by the size of the [[data]] packet and the bandwidth of the network link. Specifically, transmission delay is calculated by dividing the packet size (in bits) by the link's bandwidth (in bits per second). For example, a 1,000-bit packet transmitted over a 1 Mbps link would have a transmission delay of 1 millisecond. Unlike [[propagation delay]], which depends on the physical distance between nodes, transmission delay is influenced by the [[data]] rate of the link. High-bandwidth links reduce transmission delay, while lower-bandwidth links increase it. Minimising transmission delay is crucial for improving overall network performance, particularly in applications requiring fast [[data]] transfer, such as video streaming, online gaming, and real-time communications.
