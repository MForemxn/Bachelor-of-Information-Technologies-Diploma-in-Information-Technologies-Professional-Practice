# What is Biometric Data?
- biometric data refers to unique physical or behavioural characteristics that can be used for identifying and authenticating individuals
- includes fingerprints, facial patterns, voice recognition, and eye scans (iris or retina)
- utilised in [[security]] systems, access control, and identification [[processes]] due to its uniqueness and difficulty to replicate

# Importance of Biometric Data in [[Security]]
- offers a higher level of [[security]] compared to traditional methods like passwords or PINs, which can be forgotten, lost, or stolen
- provides a convenient and fast way for user authentication
- enhances user experience by simplifying the authentication process, especially in mobile and personal devices

# Types of Biometric Data
- physiological biometrics: based on physical characteristics of the body
	- examples include fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans, and DNA
- behavioural biometrics: based on patterns of behaviour of the individual
	- examples include voice recognition, keystroke dynamics, and gait analysis

# Methods of Collecting and Using Biometric Data
- biometric scanners and sensors: devices designed to capture and convert biometric traits into digital information
- biometric authentication systems: compare collected biometric data against stored templates to verify identity
- used in various applications, including smartphone [[security]], border control, banking, and secure access to buildings

# Challenges in Biometric Data [[Security]]
- privacy concerns: sensitive nature of biometric data raises issues regarding [[data protection]] and potential misuse
- false positives and negatives: inaccuracies in biometric systems can lead to unauthorised access or deny access to legitimate users
- permanence: unlike passwords, biometric traits cannot be easily changed if compromised
- potential for discrimination and bias in biometric systems, especially facial recognition technologies

# Biometric [[Data Protection]] Measures
- [[encryption]] of biometric data both at rest and in transit to prevent interception and misuse
- use of biometric templates instead of raw data, reducing the risk of compromising the original biometric trait
- implementing strict access controls and data minimisation principles to limit exposure and use of biometric data

# Future Trends in Biometric Technology
- multimodal biometric systems: combining multiple biometric traits to improve accuracy and [[security]]
- advancements in liveness detection to prevent spoofing attacks using fake biometrics
- integration of biometrics with blockchain technology for decentralised and secure identity verification
- increasing use of biometrics in everyday applications, from banking to consumer electronics, enhancing both [[security]] and convenience
