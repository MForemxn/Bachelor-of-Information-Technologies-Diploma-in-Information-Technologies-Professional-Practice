# What is Computer [[Security]]: Confidentiality?
- computer [[security]] confidentiality refers to the protection of information from being accessed by unauthorised parties
- it's about ensuring that sensitive data is accessible only to those who have the right to view it
- confidentiality is a key aspect of the CIA triad in computer [[security]], which also includes [[integrity]] and [[availability]]

# Importance of Confidentiality in Computer [[Security]]
- protects personal privacy and sensitive information
- prevents identity theft, financial fraud, and data breaches
- essential for maintaining trust between entities in a digital environment
- critical for compliance with laws and regulations regarding [[data protection]]

# Methods to Ensure Confidentiality
- [[encryption]]: transforming readable data into an unreadable format unless decrypted
	- uses algorithms and keys for data [[encryption]] and decryption
- access control: restricting access to data based on user roles and permissions
	- includes authentication (verifying identity) and authorisation (granting access)
- secure communication protocols: ensuring data transmitted over networks is protected
	- examples include SSL/TLS for web traffic and VPNs for secure [[remote access]]

# Challenges in Maintaining Confidentiality
- sophisticated cyber attacks targeting sensitive data
- insider threats from employees or associates with access to confidential information
- balancing the need for data accessibility with the need to protect it
- keeping up with evolving compliance requirements and [[data protection]] laws

# [[Encryption]] Techniques
- symmetric [[encryption]]: uses the same key for [[encryption]] and decryption
	- faster but requires secure key exchange
- asymmetric [[encryption]]: uses a public key for [[encryption]] and a private key for decryption
	- more secure for key distribution but slower
- common [[encryption]] standards include AES, RSA, and ECC

# Access Control Models
- discretionary access control (DAC): access is based on the identity of the user and ownership of data
- mandatory access control (MAC): access decisions are based on fixed [[security]] labels assigned to users and data
- role-based access control (RBAC): access is based on the roles assigned to users within an organisation

# Secure Communication Protocols
- SSL/TLS: secures data transmitted over the internet, used for web browsing, email, and more
- VPN: creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between a device and a network, protecting data in transit
- SSH: provides a secure channel over an unsecured network, commonly used for remote server access

# Impact of Data Breaches on Confidentiality
- loss of sensitive personal and corporate information
- financial losses due to fraud, legal fees, and penalties
- damage to reputation and loss of trust among customers and partners
- potential regulatory fines for failing to protect data

# Future Trends in Protecting Confidentiality
- increasing use of advanced [[encryption]] techniques and quantum-resistant algorithms
- development of zero trust [[security]] models, where trust is never assumed and verification is required from everyone trying to access resources
- greater emphasis on privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) to protect individual privacy without sacrificing the utility of data
