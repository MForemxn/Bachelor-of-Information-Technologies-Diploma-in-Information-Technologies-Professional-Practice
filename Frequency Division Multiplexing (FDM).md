## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) is a technique that divides the available bandwidth into multiple frequency channels to transmit multiple signals simultaneously.

## OVERVIEW:
Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) is a method used in telecommunications to transmit multiple signals over a single communication channel. By dividing the available bandwidth into distinct frequency channels, each signal is allocated a unique frequency range. This allows multiple signals to be transmitted simultaneously without interference. FDM is widely used in various applications, including radio and television broadcasting, where different channels are assigned different frequencies. It is also employed in telephone systems and internet services to maximise the use of available bandwidth. The effectiveness of FDM relies on precise frequency allocation and filtering to ensure that signals do not overlap and cause interference.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. FDM divides available bandwidth into frequency channels.
2. Multiple signals are transmitted simultaneously.
3. Each signal has a unique frequency range.
4. Prevents interference between signals.
5. Used in radio and television broadcasting.
6. Applied in telephone systems.
7. Maximises bandwidth utilisation.
8. Requires precise frequency allocation.
9. Filtering ensures no signal overlap.
10. Enhances communication efficiency.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. FDM allows simultaneous transmission of multiple signals.
2. Unique frequency ranges prevent signal interference.
3. Widely used in broadcasting and telecommunications.
4. Maximises the efficiency of available bandwidth.
5. Precise frequency management is crucial for FDM's effectiveness.
