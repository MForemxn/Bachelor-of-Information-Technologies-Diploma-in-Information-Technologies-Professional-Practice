## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Logical design involves converting an Entity-Relationship (ER) model into a relational model, creating structured tables for [[database]] [[implementation]].

## OVERVIEW:
Logical design is the [[process]] of transforming a conceptual Entity-Relationship (ER) model into a relational model, which can be implemented in a relational [[database]] management system (RDBMS). This conversion involves mapping [[entities]] to tables, [[attributes]] to columns, and relationships to foreign [[keys]]. During this [[process]], primary [[keys]] are identified to uniquely distinguish each record in a table, and foreign [[keys]] are used to establish relationships between tables. Normalisation techniques are applied to eliminate redundancy and ensure [[data]] [[integrity]]. The resulting relational model is a detailed blueprint that specifies the structure of the [[database]], including tables, columns, [[keys]], and constraints. This step is crucial for ensuring that the [[database]] is efficient, scalable, and aligned with the initial conceptual design.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Converts ER model into a relational model.
2. Maps [[entities]] to tables and [[attributes]] to columns.
3. Identifies primary [[keys]] for unique records.
4. Uses foreign [[keys]] to establish table relationships.
5. Applies normalisation to eliminate redundancy.
6. Ensures [[data]] [[integrity]] and consistency.
7. Provides a detailed blueprint for [[database]] structure.
8. Specifies tables, columns, [[keys]], and constraints.
9. Ensures [[database]] efficiency and [[scalability]].
10. Aligns with the initial conceptual design.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Logical design transforms ER [[models]] into relational tables.
2. Primary and foreign [[keys]] establish [[data]] relationships.
3. Normalisation ensures [[data]] [[integrity]] and reduces redundancy.
4. Provides a detailed and structured [[database]] blueprint.
5. Ensures the [[database]] is efficient, scalable, and consistent with the conceptual design.
