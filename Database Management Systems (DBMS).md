## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
A [[Database]] Management System (DBMS) is software that enables the creation, management, and manipulation of databases, ensuring data [[integrity]], [[security]], and efficient access.

## OVERVIEW:
A [[Database]] Management System (DBMS) is a crucial software tool that facilitates the creation, management, and manipulation of databases. It provides a systematic way to store, retrieve, and manage data, ensuring data [[integrity]], [[security]], and efficient access. DBMSs support various data [[models]], including relational, hierarchical, and [[object]]-oriented [[models]], allowing for [[flexibility]] in how data is organized and accessed. Key functionalities of a DBMS include data definition, data updating, data retrieval, and user administration. By using a DBMS, organizations can handle large volumes of data, perform complex queries, and maintain data consistency across multiple users and applications. Additionally, DBMSs offer features such as transaction management, concurrency control, and backup and recovery, which are essential for maintaining data reliability and [[availability]]. They also provide tools for defining data schemas, enforcing data [[integrity]] constraints, and managing user permissions, ensuring that data is both accurate and secure.
