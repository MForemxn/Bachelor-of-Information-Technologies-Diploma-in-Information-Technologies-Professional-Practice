# What are the 4 pillars of OOP?

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
- The 4 pillars of OOP are fundamental concepts that enable the OOP paradigm to provide a clear modular structure for programs, making it possible to handle more complex problems by breaking them down into manageable pieces.

# [[Abstraction]]
- [[Abstraction]] is the concept of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts.
- It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.
- In OOP, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

# [[Encapsulation]]
- [[Encapsulation]] is the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data, such that access to that data is restricted from outside the bundle.
- It allows the internal representation of an object to be hidden from the outside.
- This is achieved by making class members private and providing public getter and setter methods to modify and view the [[variables]]' values.

# [[Inheritance]]
- [[Inheritance]] is a mechanism wherein a new class is derived from an existing class.
- The new class, known as a subclass, inherits attributes and methods of the existing class, known as a superclass.
- It allows for code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical classification.

# [[Polymorphism]]
- [[Polymorphism]] means "many forms", and it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
- It is the ability of a single function or method to work in different ways based on the object it is acting upon.
- [[Polymorphism]] is achieved in OOP through method overriding and overloading.

# [[Implementation]] of OOP Pillars
- Each programming language that supports OOP has its own way of implementing these concepts, but the underlying principles remain the same.
- Understanding these pillars is crucial for designing robust, scalable, and maintainable software.

# Importance in Software Development
- The 4 pillars of OOP provide a structured approach to programming that facilitates:
	- Code reusability
	- Scalability
	- Simplified debugging and maintenance
- By adhering to these principles, developers can create software that is more efficient and easier to understand and modify.
