[[Communications for IT Professionals 2a Assessment All Individual Background Reports]]
# Final Introduction (edited, with headings)
An effective design proposal is a critical tool for conveying a creative process and its potential impact to its intended audience. It meticulously outlines the project specifications, objectives, and the envisioned benefits of the proposed design solution. The primary goal of this report is to present a compelling case to Engineers Without Borders (EWB), advocating for the authorisation and continuation of our [[design process]]. 

The 2024 EWB Challenge is centred around addressing the pressing environmental and societal challenges faced by the community of Saibai Island. Through an extensive research phase, our team has gathered valuable insights into the unique circumstances of Saibai Island, identifying critical areas where sustainable design solutions can significantly enhance the community's resilience and quality of life. This proposal aims to introduce a design solution that is not only practical but also deeply beneficial for the people of Saibai Island, fostering a sustainable and prosperous future.

## 1.1 Background

### Target Community – Saibai Island

Saibai Island, located at the northernmost point of Australia, near the border with Papua New Guinea, is a community deeply connected to its natural environment. The island's geography and culture are intricately linked to the surrounding waters and ecosystems, which are vital for the community's sustenance and livelihood. However, Saibai Island faces significant challenges related to waste management and environmental sustainability, impacting the health and well-being of its residents and the integrity of its natural habitats.

### Environmental and Societal Challenges

The community of Saibai Island grapples with inadequate waste management systems, leading to pollution and environmental degradation. The lack of proper sanitation facilities and sustainable waste disposal methods poses a threat to public health and the island's rich biodiversity. Furthermore, the community's remote location exacerbates these challenges, limiting access to resources and infrastructure that could mitigate these issues.

### Saibai Island Statistics

- **Population:** Approximately 500 residents
- **Geography:** Predominantly wetlands and mangroves
- **Economy:** Largely dependent on subsistence fishing and agriculture
- **Environmental Challenges:** Waste management, coastal erosion, and climate change impacts

## 1.2 EWB Challenge Design Opportunity

Our analysis of the background research and community engagement activities has highlighted the urgent need for innovative waste management solutions on Saibai Island. The prevalence of waste-related issues, coupled with the community's desire for sustainable development, presents a significant opportunity for impactful design intervention.

### Design Area: Sustainable Waste Management

Our project focuses on developing a comprehensive waste management system that promotes recycling, reduces waste generation, and engages the community in sustainable practices. By addressing the root causes of waste-related challenges, our solution aims to improve public health, protect the environment, and empower the community towards self-sufficiency and resilience.

### Scope and Objectives

- **What We Will Do:** Design and implement a community-based waste management system, incorporating education and capacity-building initiatives.
- **What We Won’t Do:** Our project will not address unrelated infrastructure or economic development challenges beyond the scope of waste management.
- **Measurable Success:** Reduction in waste generation, increased recycling rates, and improved community engagement in environmental sustainability practices.


# First Draft
In the context of the escalating waste management challenges on Saibai Island, this proposal seeks to address the pressing issue of waste accumulation and its detrimental environmental impact. Recognising the urgent need for sustainable waste management practices, our initiative aims to reframe waste as a valuable resource rather than mere refuse destined for landfill sites. This document outlines a design area focused on "Waste as a Resource," with the objective of diverting waste from landfills through innovative and practical solutions. The core of our proposal revolves around the pivotal question: Relating to the overwhelming amount of waste on Saibai Island, how can we identify alternative waste destinations in order to save the environment from landfill waste pollution?

The opportunity identified within this design project centers on the transformation of waste management practices on Saibai Island. By exploring and implementing alternative waste destinations, we endeavour not only to mitigate the environmental pollution associated with landfill waste but also to unveil the potential of waste as a catalyst for economic enrichment and community development. The essence of our approach is encapsulated in the "How might we...?" statement, serving as the guiding principle for our design solution exploration.

Our commitment to addressing the waste management issue on Saibai Island encompasses a comprehensive evaluation of the current waste practices, identification of viable waste diversion strategies, and the promotion of waste as a valuable resource for the community. We aim to do the following;

Propose innovative solutions that go beyond traditional waste disposal methods, focusing on waste reduction, reuse, and recycling as principal components of waste management.

Explore the economic potential of waste by identifying avenues through which waste can contribute to the local economy, such as material recovery, composting for agricultural use, and the development of waste-to-energy projects.

Engage with local communities, stakeholders, and experts in environmental management to foster a collaborative approach towards sustainable waste practices.

However, it is crucial to delineate the boundaries of our proposal. Our focus will primarily be on:

The identification and implementation of practical and community-oriented waste management solutions.

Initiatives that are feasible within the socio-economic and environmental context of Saibai Island.

We will not engage in:

The development of highly technical or capital-intensive projects that are not sustainable or accessible for the Saibai Island community.

Solutions that require significant alterations to the existing legal or cultural frameworks of the community without thorough consultation and consent.

This proposal, therefore, sets the stage for a transformative approach to waste management on Saibai Island, emphasizing the valorisation of waste as a resource. Through this initiative, we aspire to not only alleviate the environmental burden of waste but also to unlock new opportunities for economic and community development.
