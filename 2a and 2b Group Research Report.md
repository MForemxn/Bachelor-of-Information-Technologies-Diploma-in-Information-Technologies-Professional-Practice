# Final Introduction (edited, with headings)
An effective design proposal is a critical tool for conveying a creative process and its potential impact to its intended audience. It meticulously outlines the project specifications, objectives, and the envisioned benefits of the proposed design solution. The primary goal of this report is to present a compelling case to Engineers Without Borders (EWB), advocating for the authorisation and continuation of our [[design process]]. 

The 2024 EWB Challenge is centred around addressing the pressing environmental and societal challenges faced by the community of Saibai Island. Through an extensive research phase, our team has gathered valuable insights into the unique circumstances of Saibai Island, identifying critical areas where sustainable design solutions can significantly enhance the community's resilience and quality of life. This proposal aims to introduce a design solution that is not only practical but also deeply beneficial for the people of Saibai Island, fostering a sustainable and prosperous future.

## 1.1 Background

### Target Community – Saibai Island

Saibai Island, located at the northernmost point of Australia, near the border with Papua New Guinea, is a community deeply connected to its natural environment. The island's geography and culture are intricately linked to the surrounding waters and ecosystems, which are vital for the community's sustenance and livelihood. However, Saibai Island faces significant challenges related to waste management and environmental sustainability, impacting the health and well-being of its residents and the integrity of its natural habitats.

### Environmental and Societal Challenges

The community of Saibai Island grapples with inadequate waste management systems, leading to pollution and environmental degradation. The lack of proper sanitation facilities and sustainable waste disposal methods poses a threat to public health and the island's rich biodiversity. Furthermore, the community's remote location exacerbates these challenges, limiting access to resources and infrastructure that could mitigate these issues.

### Saibai Island Statistics (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2016)

- **Population:** Approximately 500 residents
- **Geography:** Predominantly wetlands and mangroves
- **Economy:** Largely dependent on subsistence fishing and agriculture
- **Environmental Challenges:** Waste management, coastal erosion, and climate change impacts

## 1.2 EWB Challenge Design Opportunity

Our analysis of the background research and community engagement activities has highlighted the urgent need for innovative waste management solutions on Saibai Island. The prevalence of waste-related issues, coupled with the community's desire for sustainable development, presents a significant opportunity for impactful design intervention.

### Design Area: Sustainable Waste Management

Our project focuses on developing a comprehensive waste management system that promotes recycling, reduces waste generation, and engages the community in sustainable practices. By addressing the root causes of waste-related challenges, our solution aims to improve public health, protect the environment, and empower the community towards self-sufficiency and resilience.

### Scope and Objectives

- **What We Will Do:** Design and implement a community-based waste management system, incorporating education and capacity-building initiatives.
- **What We Won’t Do:** Our project will not address unrelated infrastructure or economic development challenges beyond the scope of waste management.
- **Measurable Success:** Reduction in waste generation, increased recycling rates, and improved community engagement in environmental sustainability practices.
