## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Network Edge refers to the practice of processing [[data]] closer to its source to reduce latency and improve efficiency.

## OVERVIEW:
Network Edge, also known as Edge Computing, involves decentralising [[data]] processing by bringing it closer to the [[data]] source rather than relying on a centralised [[data]] centre. This approach is particularly beneficial for applications requiring real-time processing and low latency, such as IoT devices, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities. By processing [[data]] at the edge of the network, organisations can reduce the load on central servers, enhance [[data]] [[security]], and improve overall system performance. The Network Edge also supports [[scalability]] and [[flexibility]], allowing businesses to adapt quickly to changing demands. This technology is becoming increasingly important as the volume of [[data]] generated by connected devices continues to grow exponentially.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Network Edge [[processes]] [[data]] closer to its source.
2. Reduces latency and improves efficiency.
3. Ideal for real-time applications like IoT and autonomous vehicles.
4. Decreases load on central servers.
5. Enhances [[data]] [[security]].
6. Improves overall system performance.
7. Supports [[scalability]] and [[flexibility]].
8. Adapts quickly to changing demands.
9. Essential for managing growing [[data]] volumes.
10. Facilitates smart cities and advanced technologies.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Network Edge minimises latency by processing [[data]] locally.
2. Enhances [[security]] by reducing [[data]] transmission to central servers.
3. Supports real-time applications and IoT devices.
4. Offers [[scalability]] and [[flexibility]] for businesses.
5. Essential for handling the exponential growth of [[data]].
