## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
SQL commands are categorised into DDL, DML, DCL, and TCL, each serving distinct purposes in database management and manipulation.

## OVERVIEW:
SQL (Structured Query Language) commands are essential for managing and manipulating databases. They are divided into four main categories: Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Control Language (DCL), and Transaction Control Language (TCL). DDL commands, such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP, are used to define and modify database structures. DML commands, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, handle data retrieval and manipulation within the database. DCL commands, like GRANT and REVOKE, manage permissions and access controls. TCL commands, such as COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT, are used to manage transactions, ensuring data integrity and consistency. Understanding these categories and their specific commands is crucial for effective database administration and development.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. SQL commands are divided into DDL, DML, DCL, and TCL.
2. DDL commands define and modify database structures.
3. CREATE, ALTER, and DROP are examples of DDL commands.
4. DML commands handle data retrieval and manipulation.
5. SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE are DML commands.
6. DCL commands manage permissions and access controls.
7. GRANT and REVOKE are examples of DCL commands.
8. TCL commands manage transactions in the database.
9. COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT are TCL commands.
10. Understanding these commands is crucial for database management.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. DDL commands are essential for defining database schema.
2. DML commands are used for data manipulation within tables.
3. DCL commands control user access and permissions.
4. TCL commands ensure transaction integrity and consistency.
5. Mastery of these SQL commands is vital for effective database administration.
