## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Socket programming enables the creation of network applications by establishing communication channels between devices over a network using sockets.

## OVERVIEW:
Socket programming is a method used to enable communication between devices over a network, forming the backbone of many network applications. A socket is an endpoint for sending or receiving [[data]] across a computer network. In socket programming, a server creates a socket, binds it to a specific port, and listens for incoming connections. A client creates a socket and connects to the server's socket using the server's [[IP address]] and port number. Once a connection is established, [[data]] can be exchanged between the client and server using various protocols, such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable, connection-oriented communication, or UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for faster, connectionless communication. Socket programming is fundamental for developing applications like web servers, chat applications, and file transfer services, providing the necessary tools to manage network connections and [[data]] exchange.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Socket programming enables network communication between devices.
2. A socket is an endpoint for [[data]] transmission.
3. Servers create, bind, and listen on sockets.
4. Clients create sockets and connect to server sockets.
5. TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication.
6. UDP offers faster, connectionless communication.
7. [[Data]] exchange occurs once a connection is established.
8. Essential for developing web servers, chat apps, and file transfer services.
9. Manages network connections and [[data]] exchange.
10. Supports various communication protocols.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Socket programming establishes communication channels over networks.
2. Sockets serve as endpoints for [[data]] transmission.
3. TCP and UDP are key protocols for socket communication.
4. Enables the development of diverse network applications.
5. Manages connections and [[data]] exchange efficiently.
