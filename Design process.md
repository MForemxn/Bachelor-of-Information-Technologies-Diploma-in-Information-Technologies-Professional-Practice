- There are five key stages of the design process:
	- Empathise
		- **What** are their issues?
		- **Who** is affected?
		- **What** do they need?
	- Define
		- From your conversations, decide on a problem that needs to be solved. Define this problem as a "how might we..." **problem statement.**
		- Narrow our problem into a "**How might we...**" to focus on the solution, rather than the problem.
		- What are the causes and effects of this problem? Economic? Environmental? Socio-Economical? Socio-Cultural?
	- Ideate
		- Brainstorm possible solutions to your problem statement - crazy ideas are welcome!
	- Prototype
		- Select one idea to take forward.
		- How can you represent your idea to communicate with others? What is the exact problem we are solving?
	- Test
		- Share your idea with users for feedback: What will work? What won't?
