ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
File [[input]] and [[output]] operations enable reading from and writing to files, facilitating [[data persistence]] and exchange.

MAIN POINTS:
1. File [[input]] operations read [[data]] from a file into a program.
2. File [[output]] operations write [[data]] from a program to a file.
3. Opening a file is the first step in both [[input]] and [[output]] operations.
4. Closing a file ensures that all [[data]] is properly saved and resources are released.
5. [[File modes]] determine how a file is opened, affecting its [[readability]] and writability.
6. [[Buffering]] can optimize file I/O operations by reducing the number of direct disk accesses.
7. Text and binary are the two primary file formats for I/O operations.
8. [[Error handling]] is crucial to manage [[exceptions]] and ensure [[data]] [[integrity]] during I/O operations.
9. [[File paths]] can be absolute or relative, directing to the file's location.
10. Stream-based I/O allows for continuous reading or writing of [[data]], useful for large files.

TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding file I/O operations is essential for [[data persistence]] in applications.
2. Proper file handling, including opening and closing files, is critical for [[resource management]].
3. The choice between text and binary formats depends on the [[data]]'s nature and application requirements.
4. Efficient file I/O can be achieved through [[buffering]] and stream-based operations.
5. [[Error handling]] in file I/O operations ensures robustness and reliability of [[software applications]].
