## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Risk [[identification]] in [[cybersecurity]] involves recognising potential threats and vulnerabilities to protect [[information systems]] and [[data]] from cyber attacks.

## OVERVIEW:
Risk [[identification]] is a critical component of [[cybersecurity]], focusing on recognising and understanding potential threats and vulnerabilities that could compromise [[information systems]] and [[data]]. This [[Process]] involves systematically identifying risks that could impact the [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], and [[availability]] of information. Effective risk [[identification]] helps organisations anticipate and mitigate potential cyber threats, ensuring robust [[security]] measures are in place. It includes analysing internal and external threats, assessing vulnerabilities, and understanding the potential impact of different types of cyber attacks. By identifying risks early, organisations can develop strategies to prevent breaches, minimise damage, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. This proactive approach is essential for maintaining the [[security]] and resilience of [[information systems]] in an increasingly complex and hostile cyber environment.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Risk [[identification]] is crucial for [[cybersecurity]].
2. It involves recognising potential threats and vulnerabilities.
3. Focuses on protecting [[information systems]] and [[data]].
4. Ensures [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], and [[availability]] of information.
5. Systematic [[identification]] of risks is essential.
6. Analyses both internal and external threats.
7. Assesses vulnerabilities within the system.
8. Understands the impact of various cyber attacks.
9. Helps in developing preventive strategies.
