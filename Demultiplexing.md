## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Demultiplexing is the [[process]] of separating a multiplexed signal back into its original individual signals for proper [[data]] [[interpretation]].

## OVERVIEW:
Demultiplexing is the reverse [[process]] of [[multiplexing]], where a combined signal is separated back into its original individual signals. This technique is essential in telecommunications and [[data]] communication systems, ensuring that the transmitted [[data]] can be correctly interpreted and utilised at the receiving end. Just as there are various types of [[multiplexing]], there are corresponding types of demultiplexing, such as Time Division Demultiplexing (TDD), Frequency Division Demultiplexing (FDD), and Wavelength Division Demultiplexing (WDD). In TDD, the demultiplexer assigns the received time slots to the appropriate signals. In FDD, it separates the signals based on their frequency bands, and in WDD, it uses different wavelengths to distinguish the signals. Demultiplexing is crucial for maintaining the [[integrity]] and accuracy of [[data]] transmission, ensuring that each signal reaches its intended destination without interference from other signals.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Separates multiplexed signals into original individual signals.
2. Essential for correct [[data]] [[interpretation]] at the receiving end.
3. Types include TDD, FDD, and WDD.
4. TDD assigns time slots to signals.
5. FDD separates signals by frequency bands.
6. WDD distinguishes signals by wavelengths.
7. Maintains [[data]] transmission [[integrity]].
8. Ensures accurate signal delivery.
9. Prevents signal interference.
10. Crucial in telecommunications and [[data]] communication systems.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Demultiplexing is vital for accurate [[data]] [[interpretation]].
2. Various types of demultiplexing correspond to [[multiplexing]] methods.
3. Ensures each signal reaches its intended destination.
4. Maintains the [[integrity]] of transmitted [[data]].
5. Prevents interference between multiple signals.
