## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
SMART objectives are specific, measurable, agreed-upon, realistic, and time-specific targets that guide organisations in achieving their strategic goals effectively.

## OVERVIEW:
SMART objectives are a framework used to set clear and achievable targets within an organisation. The acronym SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Agreed-upon, Realistic, and Time-specific. These criteria ensure that objectives are well-defined and actionable. Specific objectives clearly state what needs to be accomplished, leaving no room for ambiguity. Measurable objectives include criteria for tracking progress and assessing success. Agreed-upon objectives are those that have been discussed and accepted by all relevant stakeholders, ensuring commitment and alignment. Realistic objectives are attainable and consider the available resources and constraints. Time-specific objectives have a clear deadline, providing a sense of urgency and a timeframe for completion. By adhering to the SMART criteria, organisations can set objectives that are clear, focused, and aligned with their strategic goals, thereby enhancing the likelihood of successful outcomes.
