## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Cyber Security Governance (CSG) involves establishing policies, procedures, and controls to manage and mitigate cyber risks, ensuring organisational security and compliance.

## OVERVIEW:
Cyber Security Governance (CSG) is a critical framework that organisations implement to manage and mitigate cyber risks effectively. It encompasses the establishment of policies, procedures, and controls designed to protect information assets and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. CSG involves defining roles and responsibilities, setting security objectives, and creating a culture of security awareness across the organisation. Key components include risk management, incident response planning, compliance monitoring, and continuous improvement. By implementing robust CSG, organisations can safeguard their data, maintain the trust of stakeholders, and minimise the impact of cyber threats. Effective CSG requires collaboration across all levels of the organisation, from top management to individual employees, ensuring that security measures are integrated into every aspect of operations. Regular audits and assessments are also essential to evaluate the effectiveness of the governance framework and make necessary adjustments.
