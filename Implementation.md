# What is Implementation?
- implementation in the context of the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to the process of deploying the developed system into a live environment
- it involves:
	- setting up the necessary hardware and software infrastructure
	- configuring the system according to the specific needs of the organisation or end-users
	- training users on how to effectively use the system
- marks the transition from the development phase to the operational phase of the system

# Key Steps in the Implementation Process
- preparation of the environment
	- ensuring all hardware and software prerequisites are met
- data migration
	- transferring existing data into the new system, often requiring data cleansing and mapping
- system configuration and customisation
	- adjusting settings and parameters to match the operational requirements
- user training and support materials creation
	- developing guides, manuals, and training programs for end-users
- testing in the live environment
	- conducting final tests to ensure the system operates as expected under real conditions

# Types of Implementation Strategies
- direct (big bang) implementation
	- switching over from the old system to the new system in one action
- phased implementation
	- gradually introducing components of the new system over time
- parallel implementation
	- running both the old and new systems simultaneously for a period
- pilot implementation
	- initially rolling out the system to a small group of users before a full launch

# Challenges in Implementation
- resistance to change from users
	- users may be accustomed to the old system and hesitant to adopt the new one
- unforeseen technical issues
	- problems that weren't identified during testing may emerge in the live environment
- data [[integrity]] and loss concerns
	- ensuring that all data is accurately transferred and no critical information is lost
- training and support
	- providing adequate training and support to all users to ensure smooth transition

# Best Practices for Successful Implementation
- comprehensive planning and preparation
	- detailed planning to anticipate and mitigate potential issues
- effective communication and change management
	- keeping all stakeholders informed and involved throughout the process
- thorough testing and quality assurance
	- extensive testing to ensure the system meets all requirements and operates reliably
- post-implementation review and feedback collection
	- evaluating the implementation process and collecting feedback to identify areas for improvement

# Post-Implementation Support
- ongoing support is crucial to address any issues that arise after the system goes live
- may include:
	- helpdesk support for user queries and issues
	- regular system updates and patches
	- additional training sessions as needed
- ensures the system continues to meet the needs of its users and remains secure and efficient
