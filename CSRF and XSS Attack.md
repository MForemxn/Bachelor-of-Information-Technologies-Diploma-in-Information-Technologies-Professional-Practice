# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
CSRF and XSS are [[web security]] vulnerabilities where CSRF tricks users into executing unwanted actions, while XSS injects malicious scripts into web pages.

# OVERVIEW:
[[Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]] and Cross-Site [[Scripting]] (XSS) are two prevalent web [[security]] vulnerabilities that exploit different aspects of [[web applications]]. CSRF attacks occur when a malicious actor tricks a user into performing actions they did not intend, such as changing account settings or making transactions, by exploiting the user's authenticated session with a web application. This is often achieved by embedding malicious requests in third-party websites or emails. XSS attacks, on the other hand, involve injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, and can even rewrite the content of the HTML page. XSS vulnerabilities arise when user [[input]] is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject scripts into web pages. Both CSRF and XSS can lead to unauthorized actions, [[data]] theft, and compromised user accounts. Mitigating these attacks involves implementing [[security]] measures such as [[input validation]], using anti-CSRF tokens, and setting secure cookie [[attributes]].

# MAIN POINTS:
1. CSRF tricks users into executing unintended actions on authenticated sessions.
2. XSS injects malicious scripts into web pages to steal [[data]] or manipulate content.
3. CSRF exploits the trust a web application has in the user's browser.
4. XSS exploits insufficient [[input validation]] to execute scripts.
5. Both attacks can lead to unauthorized actions and [[data]] theft.
6. CSRF often involves embedding malicious requests in third-party sites.
7. XSS can steal cookies, session tokens, and sensitive information.
8. Mitigation includes [[input validation]] and anti-CSRF tokens.
9. Secure cookie [[attributes]] [[help]] protect against these vulnerabilities.
10. Understanding CSRF and XSS is crucial for web application [[security]].

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. CSRF and XSS are serious web vulnerabilities with significant [[security]] implications.
2. Proper [[input validation]] and sanitization are key to preventing XSS.
3. Anti-CSRF tokens are effective in mitigating CSRF attacks.
4. Secure cookie practices enhance protection against these threats.
5. Awareness and understanding of these attacks are essential for developers and [[security]] professionals.
