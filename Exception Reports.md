	- This exception report can [[help]] a customer service proactively head off customer dissatisfaction. If you establish "acceptable" shipping timeframes - the elapsed time between receiving an order from a customer and shipping it out - then you can generate exception reports that alert you only when an order has failed to ship within these timeframes.
