## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Transition requirements define the necessary steps and conditions for moving from the current [[state]] to the desired future [[state]] in a project.

## OVERVIEW:
Transition requirements are essential for ensuring a smooth shift from the current [[state]] to the desired future [[state]] in any project. These requirements outline the specific actions, resources, and conditions needed to facilitate this transition. They address aspects such as [[data]] migration, training, change management, and system integration. By clearly defining transition requirements, organizations can minimize disruptions, ensure continuity, and achieve a seamless [[implementation]] of new [[processes]] or systems. These requirements [[help]] in identifying potential risks and developing mitigation strategies, ensuring that all stakeholders are prepared for the change. Properly documented transition requirements also provide a roadmap for the transition [[Process]], enabling effective planning and execution. They ensure that the project meets its objectives and that the benefits of the new [[state]] are fully realized.
