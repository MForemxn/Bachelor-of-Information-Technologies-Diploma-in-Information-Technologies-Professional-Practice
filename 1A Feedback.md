After going through the [[feedback]] provided to me of my Saibai Island report, my lack of specific reference to the islands specific challenges has proved to make the report seem quite generic, and means the report does not sufficiently highlight the island's unique challenges. The [[feedback]] commends my concentration on the island's environmental concerns, including waste management, microplastics, and ghost nets, and recognises my strengths in emphasising the geographical and environmental threats to the local population. 

However, the [[feedback]] plainly identifies areas where my report is lacking. A significant problem is the absence of explicit references. This was mostly due to the stage of the draft, being more of a research information dump than a finalised report. I need to keep a record of my sources as I draft, making sure they are clearly marked within my text and listed at the end of my document. Another point raised was about the arrangement and format of my report. 

Although my ideas are logically sequenced, my report is currently in bulet point format, which makes the document challenging to read and less formal than it should be. This [[feedback]] has highlighted the importance of formatting my work into a cohesive and readable report.

As a result of this [[feedback]], I intend to amend my report by integrating these modifications. I'll concentrate on enhancing my citation technique and restructuring my content into a more organised, paragraph-based format. This should not only make my report easier to read but also more in line with a professional research report.
