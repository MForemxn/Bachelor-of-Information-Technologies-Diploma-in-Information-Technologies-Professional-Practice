## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Risk evaluation in [[cybersecurity]] assesses the potential impact and likelihood of identified risks to prioritise mitigation efforts effectively.

## OVERVIEW:
Risk evaluation is a fundamental step in the [[cybersecurity]] [[risk management]] [[Process]], focusing on assessing the potential impact and likelihood of identified risks. This [[Process]] helps organisations prioritise their mitigation efforts by determining which risks pose the greatest threat to their [[information systems]] and [[data]]. Risk evaluation involves analysing the severity of potential consequences, the probability of occurrence, and the effectiveness of existing controls. By quantifying and comparing risks, organisations can allocate resources more efficiently and develop targeted strategies to address the most critical vulnerabilities. This systematic approach ensures that [[cybersecurity]] measures are both effective and cost-efficient, reducing the overall risk exposure. Additionally, risk evaluation supports informed [[decision]]-making and helps maintain compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements. Ultimately, it enhances an organisation's ability to protect its assets and maintain operational continuity in the face of evolving cyber threats.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Risk evaluation assesses impact and likelihood of risks.
2. Prioritises mitigation efforts based on risk severity.
3. Analyses potential consequences and probability of risks.
4. Evaluates effectiveness of existing controls.
5. Quantifies and compares risks for resource allocation.
6. Develops targeted strategies for critical vulnerabilities.
7. Ensures cost-efficient [[cybersecurity]] measures.
8. Supports informed [[decision]]-making.
9. Maintains compliance with industry standards.
10. Enhances protection and operational continuity.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Effective risk evaluation prioritises critical [[cybersecurity]] threats.
2. Quantifying risks aids in efficient resource allocation.
3. Evaluating controls ensures robust [[cybersecurity]] measures.
4. Informed [[decision]]-making improves overall [[security]] posture.
5. Compliance with standards is supported through systematic risk evaluation.
