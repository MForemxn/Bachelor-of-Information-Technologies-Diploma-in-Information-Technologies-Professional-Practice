# What is Internet Infrastructure?
- internet infrastructure refers to the physical and virtual technologies that enable the internet to function
- it encompasses a wide range of components, including:
	- hardware (servers, routers, cables, data centres)
	- software (protocols, services, applications)
	- connectivity providers (ISPs, backbone providers)
- crucial for global communication, commerce, and information exchange

# Key Components of Internet Infrastructure
- the internet's infrastructure is built on several key components:
	- **Networking Hardware**: devices like routers, switches, and modems that direct internet traffic
	- **Servers**: powerful computers that store and serve data and web pages to users
	- **Data Centres**: facilities that house servers and related equipment, providing the physical or virtual infrastructure required for internet services
	- **Cables and Connectivity**: includes undersea cables, fibre optic cables, and wireless connections that link continents, countries, and local networks
	- **Protocols**: rules and standards (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS) that enable different parts of the internet to communicate effectively

# Connectivity Providers
- internet service providers (ISPs) play a crucial role in internet infrastructure
	- they offer services to consumers and businesses, connecting them to the wider internet
- backbone providers are another critical component
	- they operate the high-capacity network routes that carry large amounts of internet traffic across regions and continents
- peering arrangements between providers ensure efficient data exchange and connectivity

# Evolution of Internet Infrastructure
- the internet's infrastructure has evolved significantly since its inception
	- from dial-up connections to broadband, fibre optics, and wireless technologies
- advancements in hardware and software have enabled higher speeds, greater capacity, and more reliable connections
- ongoing developments in areas like 5G, satellite internet, and edge computing are shaping the future of internet infrastructure

# Challenges and Considerations
- maintaining and upgrading internet infrastructure presents various challenges:
	- scalability to accommodate growing data demands
	- [[security]] measures to protect against cyber threats
	- ensuring equitable access across different regions and communities
- environmental impact is also a concern, with efforts underway to make data centres and network operations more energy-efficient and sustainable
