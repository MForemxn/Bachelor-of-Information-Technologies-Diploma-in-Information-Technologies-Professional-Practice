## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Authorization in computer [[security]] determines the permissions and access levels granted to authenticated users or systems to ensure proper resource usage.

## OVERVIEW:
Authorization in computer [[security]] is the [[Process]] of determining what an authenticated user or system is allowed to do within a network or application. After [[authentication]] confirms the identity, authorization defines the specific permissions and access levels granted to that identity. This [[Process]] is crucial for enforcing [[security]] policies and ensuring that users can only access resources and perform actions that they are explicitly permitted to. Authorization mechanisms can be role-based, attribute-based, or policy-based, among others. Effective authorization helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive [[data]] and critical systems, thereby protecting the [[integrity]], [[confidentiality]], and [[availability]] of resources. It also supports compliance with regulatory requirements and organizational policies. As [[security]] threats evolve, authorization methods must be continuously reviewed and updated to address new vulnerabilities and ensure robust protection.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Authorization determines permissions for authenticated users or systems.
2. Ensures proper resource usage and access control.
3. Follows [[authentication]] to define access levels.
4. Enforces [[security]] policies and permissions.
5. Can be role-based, attribute-based, or policy-based.
6. Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive [[data]].
7. Protects resource [[integrity]], [[confidentiality]], and [[availability]].
8. Supports regulatory compliance and organizational policies.
9. Must be reviewed and updated regularly.
10. Essential for robust [[security]] and [[risk mitigation]].

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Authorization defines what authenticated users can do.
2. Ensures users access only permitted resources.
3. Enforces [[security]] policies and permissions.
4. Prevents unauthorized access and protects [[data]].
5. Needs continuous review to address evolving threats.
