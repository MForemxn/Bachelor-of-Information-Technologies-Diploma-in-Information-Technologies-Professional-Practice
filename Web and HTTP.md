## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The web relies on the HTTP protocol to facilitate the exchange of information between clients and servers, enabling web browsing and [[data]] transfer.

## OVERVIEW:
The World Wide Web (web) is a system of interlinked hypertext documents and multimedia content accessed via [[the internet]]. It operates primarily through the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning each request from a client to a server is independent of previous requests. Web browsers act as clients, sending HTTP requests to web servers, which respond with the requested resources, such as HTML pages, images, or videos. HTTP/HTTPS (secure HTTP) ensures secure [[data]] transmission through [[encryption]]. The web's architecture supports hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate seamlessly between different resources. HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE enable various operations on web resources, facilitating dynamic and interactive [[web applications]].

## MAIN POINTS:
1. The web consists of interlinked hypertext documents and multimedia.
2. HTTP defines message formatting and transmission rules.
3. Stateless protocol: each request is independent.
4. Web browsers send HTTP requests to servers.
5. Servers respond with requested resources (HTML, images, videos).
6. HTTPS ensures secure [[data]] transmission.
7. Hyperlinks enable seamless navigation between resources.
8. HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
9. Facilitates dynamic and interactive [[web applications]].
10. Web architecture supports client-server communication.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. The web uses HTTP for client-server communication.
2. HTTP is a stateless protocol for independent requests.
3. Web browsers request, and servers provide, web resources.
4. HTTPS secures [[data]] transmission through [[encryption]].
5. HTTP methods enable various operations on web resources.
