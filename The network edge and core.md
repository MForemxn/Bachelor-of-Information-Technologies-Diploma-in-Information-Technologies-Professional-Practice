# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The [[network edge]] and core are fundamental components of network architecture, with the edge handling end-user interactions and the core managing high-speed [[data]] transmission between networks.

# OVERVIEW:
In network architecture, the [[network edge]] and core play crucial roles in ensuring efficient [[data]] transmission and connectivity. The [[network edge]] refers to the outermost part of the network where end-user devices, such as computers, smartphones, and IoT devices, connect to the network. This area includes access points, routers, and switches that facilitate the initial connection and manage [[data]] traffic between end-users and the broader network. The edge is responsible for handling tasks like [[data]] collection, processing, and delivery to end-users, often incorporating [[security]] measures to protect against threats.

The [[network core]], on the other hand, is the central part of the network that provides high-speed, reliable [[data]] transmission between different network segments. It consists of high-capacity routers and switches designed to handle large volumes of [[data]] with minimal latency. The core network ensures that [[data]] packets are efficiently routed between various edge networks and [[data]] centres, maintaining the overall performance and stability of the network. Together, the [[network edge]] and core form a cohesive system that supports seamless communication and [[data]] exchange across the entire network infrastructure.
