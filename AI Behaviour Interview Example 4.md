To provide a well-suited recommendation for your POS transition from Lightspeed to either Square POS, Shopify POS, or another system, I'd need to consider several factors about your business operations and requirements. Here's a breakdown of key considerations and how each POS system aligns with them:

### 1. Business Model and Size

- **Square POS** is excellent for small to medium-sized businesses that need a simple and intuitive interface with seamless integration between in-store and online sales. It is particularly well-suited for businesses that also handle a lot of mobile or off-site transactions (e.g., markets, mobile services).
- **Shopify POS** is ideal if you are heavily invested in e-commerce and want a unified platform that handles both online and offline inventories and sales. It's perfect for businesses that operate both a physical store and one or more online stores.

### 2. Integration with Woocommerce

- **Square POS** offers integration capabilities with WooCommerce through third-party plugins. This integration can sync inventory and sales [[data]], but it might require additional setup and possibly extra costs for plugins.
- **Shopify POS**, when used with Shopify’s own e-commerce platform, provides a seamless integration experience. However, integrating Shopify POS with WooCommerce can be complex and might not provide as seamless an experience as using Shopify for both POS and e-commerce.

### 3. Features and Functionality

- **Square POS** provides a wide range of features including inventory management, customer management, and detailed analytics. It also offers flexibility with hardware, where you can use existing iPads or purchase Square’s own hardware.
- **Shopify POS** excels in features that unify in-store and online operations. Its inventory management is robust, and it can offer deeper analytics on sales and customer patterns if used with Shopify’s e-commerce platform.

### 4. Pricing Structure

- **Square POS** has a transparent pricing model with no monthly fees for the basic version; you only pay per transaction. This can be cost-effective for businesses with variable sales volumes.
- **Shopify POS** requires a monthly subscription, which includes the POS system and integration with the Shopify e-commerce platform. This can be a higher initial cost but provides extensive features.

### 5. Ease of Use and Customer Support

- Both POS systems are known for their ease of use and good customer support. Square might have a slight edge in simplicity and ease of setup, while Shopify offers more extensive support resources online.

### 6. Hardware and Mobility

- **Square POS** offers more flexibility in terms of hardware, and can be a cheaper option if you already have compatible tablets or smartphones.
- **Shopify POS** generally requires Shopify’s hardware to get the most out of its features, especially for integrating in-store and online sales seamlessly.

### Recommendation

If your priority is seamless integration with WooCommerce and cost is a major consideration, **Square POS** might be the better option given its compatibility with third-party plugins for WooCommerce and a pay-per-transaction pricing model. However, if you are planning to scale and might consider transitioning your e-commerce platform from WooCommerce to a more unified system in the future, or if you need deep integration between your in-store and online operations from the get-go, **Shopify POS** could be more advantageous despite the potentially higher cost and complexity of integrating it with WooCommerce.

In any case, considering a demo or trial period for each POS system could provide valuable insights into what would work best for your specific business setup and needs.

Given the scale of your business and the monthly transaction volume, it's important to choose a POS system that can efficiently handle high sales volume, provide robust analytics, and integrate seamlessly with your existing online platforms. Let’s expand the comparison to include not only Square and Shopify POS, but also Toast POS, which is well-suited for larger businesses and might be another viable option:

### 1. Square POS

- **Pros:** Square POS is renowned for its simplicity and reliability. It offers robust sales analytics, inventory management, and customer tracking. The cost model is generally straightforward, primarily transaction-based with options for added features at additional costs.
- **Cons:** While scalable, Square can become costly for larger businesses due to its transaction fees. Its integration with WooCommerce might also require additional plugins and management, adding complexity.

### 2. Shopify POS

- **Pros:** Shopify POS offers excellent integration within the Shopify ecosystem, making it ideal if you consider transitioning to Shopify for online sales. It supports high-volume transactions well and offers extensive analytics.
- **Cons:** The integration with WooCommerce is not as straightforward, potentially requiring significant workaround or even a platform switch. Also, the subscription costs can be high, particularly when scaling up hardware and feature needs.

### 3. Toast POS

- **Pros:** Toast is particularly strong in high-volume environments and offers extensive customization options, which can be beneficial for a larger business looking to tailor their POS system to specific needs. It includes features like loyalty programs, gift card management, and advanced reporting.
- **Cons:** Toast is primarily focused on the food service industry but has been expanding to broader retail applications. The initial setup can be costly, and it primarily uses proprietary hardware, which could increase initial costs.

### 4. Lightspeed POS (current system)

- **Pros:** Since you are already using Lightspeed POS, it’s worth noting that Lightspeed offers powerful inventory management, detailed reporting, and scalability suited for larger businesses. It also has good integration capabilities with various e-commerce platforms.
- **Cons:** If there are specific reasons you're considering a switch (e.g., cost, customer service issues, feature limitations), these should be weighed heavily in your decision.

### Recommendation for a Larger Business

For a business of your size, transitioning to a POS that can efficiently manage high transaction volumes while providing robust [[data]] analytics and inventory management is crucial. Here’s a tailored recommendation:

- **If staying with WooCommerce is a priority and transaction fees are a concern:** Staying with **Lightspeed** or considering **Square POS** with additional investment in integration might be suitable. However, be aware of the transaction fees with Square as they can add up at high volumes.
- **If considering a platform switch for better integration and scalability:** **Shopify POS** could be advantageous. Transitioning your online store to Shopify would allow you to leverage full integration, which is seamless and highly efficient.
- **If looking for a highly customizable system that supports high volumes:** **Toast POS** could be a strong option, particularly if you're open to using their hardware and investing in a system that can be tailored extensively to meet your needs.

Each system has its strengths and potential drawbacks depending on specific business needs such as cost considerations, existing infrastructure, and future scalability. Conducting trials where possible, or at least detailed consultations with each provider, would help make an informed decision tailored to your business's specific requirements.

Understood, with Lightspeed POS not being an option, let’s focus on finding the best alternative that fits the needs of a larger business handling substantial monthly sales. Here's a refined analysis considering your circumstances and excluding Lightspeed:

### Square POS

- **Pros:** Known for its intuitive interface, comprehensive feature set including robust inventory management, customer profiles, and integration options with third-party apps for WooCommerce.
- **Cons:** While suitable for various business sizes, the transaction fee model can become costly for a business with your sales volume, potentially eating into margins.

### Shopify POS

- **Pros:** Best for businesses looking for tight integration between their retail and online operations, especially if you’re considering transitioning entirely to Shopify for e-commerce in the future. Provides strong inventory management and unified customer [[data]] across platforms.
- **Cons:** Integration with WooCommerce is not straightforward, potentially requiring switching to Shopify’s e-commerce platform for optimal use, which would mean moving away from WooCommerce.

### Toast POS

- **Pros:** Excellent for high-volume transactions with robust customization options. Includes features beneficial for loyalty programs and advanced reporting. Can handle the demands of a large, busy retail environment.
- **Cons:** Initially developed for restaurants and food services, but it’s expanding to general retail. Could involve higher upfront costs due to proprietary hardware requirements.

### Additional Recommendation: Oracle NetSuite POS

- **Pros:** This is a more enterprise-focused solution that supports large-scale operations. NetSuite offers extensive features including ERP (enterprise resource planning), CRM (customer relationship management), and e-commerce integrations. It's designed for complex businesses needing comprehensive [[data]] analytics and management.
- **Cons:** It is generally more expensive than other POS systems and requires a significant commitment to training and implementation.

### Final Recommendation

Given your sales volume and the requirement for effective integration with an online platform, here are the considerations:

1. **If cost of transactions is a primary concern but you wish to maintain WooCommerce:** **Square POS** might still be a viable option if you invest in the right integration tools, despite the potential high cost

You

alright i’ve narrowed it down to square and shopify. can you give me some price comparisons at different sales volumes?

ChatGPT

ChatGPT

Certainly, let's dive into a detailed comparison of pricing for Square POS and Shopify POS at varying sales volumes. These comparisons will help clarify how each POS system may impact your business financially depending on your monthly sales.

### Square POS Pricing:

- **Transaction Fees**: Square typically charges a transaction fee of 2.6% + 10¢ for each tapped (contactless), dipped (chip), or swiped (magstripe) card transaction.
- **Keyed-In Transactions**: For manually entered transactions, the fee is higher, at 3.5% + 15¢ per transaction.
- **Monthly Fees**: There is no monthly fee for the basic Square POS app, which includes features like inventory tracking, customer feedback, and more. Advanced features, however, may require subscribing to additional services such as Square for Retail or Square for Restaurants, which start at $60 per month.

### Shopify POS Pricing:

- **Basic Shopify Plan**: This plan costs $29/month and includes Shopify POS with a 2.7% fee per transaction for credit card rates.
- **Shopify Plan**: At $79/month, this includes Shopify POS with a lower transaction fee of 2.5% per transaction.
- **Advanced Shopify Plan**: Priced at $299/month, it further reduces the transaction fee to 2.4% per transaction. This plan includes advanced reporting and other features suitable for larger businesses.

### Scenario-Based Pricing Comparison:

Let’s calculate the monthly costs for both systems at different monthly sales volumes, assuming all transactions are made with credit or debit cards at physical locations (not manually keyed in):

1. **$200,000 in Sales per Month**
2. **$300,000 in Sales per Month**

#### Calculations:

For Square, using the basic POS with no monthly fees and the transaction rate of 2.6% + 10¢ per transaction.

For Shopify, we'll compare using the Shopify and Advanced Shopify plans, as the Basic Shopify plan is generally not suitable for high sales volumes.

#### Assumptions:

- Average transaction value is $50 (this is needed to calculate the impact of the fixed per-transaction fee for Square).

Let's compute the total costs for these scenarios.

 8400.0,
 {'Shopify': 5079.0, 'Advanced Shopify': 5099.0},
 {'Shopify': 7579.0, 'Advanced Shopify': 7499.0})

Here are the cost comparisons for Square POS and Shopify POS based on monthly sales volumes of $200,000 and $300,000:

### Costs for $200,000 in Sales per Month

- **Square POS**: $5,600
- **Shopify POS**:
    - Shopify Plan: $5,079
    - Advanced Shopify Plan: $5,099

### Costs for $300,000 in Sales per Month

- **Square POS**: $8,400
- **Shopify POS**:
    - Shopify Plan: $7,579
    - Advanced Shopify Plan: $7,499

### Analysis

- For both $200,000 and $300,000 sales volumes, **Shopify POS** is more cost-effective than Square POS. This holds true especially if you opt for the Advanced Shopify Plan, which although having a higher monthly fee, benefits from a slightly lower transaction fee percentage that makes it more economical at higher sales volumes.
- **Square POS** has higher costs mainly due to the combination of percentage-based fees and fixed fees per transaction, which accumulate significantly as the number of transactions increases.

Given these calculations, if the integration with your existing online platform can be managed effectively, Shopify POS, particularly the Advanced Shopify Plan, may be more financially advantageous for your business due to its lower relative costs at high sales volumes. However, this should be balanced against the ease of integration with WooCommerce and any potential costs or operational challenges associated with switching or managing two separate platforms. ​​

we probably won’t be using square to handle our payments, we have standalone eftpos machines for that. we would just use it as a register.

ChatGPT

If you're considering using Square POS strictly as a register and not for processing payments, this significantly alters the cost analysis, as you would primarily be dealing with the costs associated with the POS software and hardware, without the transaction fees.

### Square POS as a Register

- **No Transaction Fees**: Since you won't be using Square to handle payments, the transaction fees mentioned previously do not apply. This makes Square a potentially more cost-effective option if you're looking for a robust POS system to manage sales, track inventory, and handle customer interactions without processing payments through it.
- **Monthly Software Fees**: Square offers different software packages depending on your needs. For instance:
    - **Square for Retail**: Starts at $60 per month per location. It provides advanced inventory management, vendor management, and more detailed sales reporting.
    - **Square Standard**: There's no monthly fee for the basic version, which includes basic POS functionalities.
- **Hardware Costs**: Depending on your current setup, you might need to invest in hardware like iPads, stands, receipt printers, or barcode scanners. Square provides options for purchasing or leasing this equipment.

### Shopify POS as a Register

- **Monthly Plan Fees**: Even if you're not using Shopify to process payments, you still have to pay the monthly subscription fee for using their POS system, which includes inventory management, sales tracking, and customer management.
    - The fees range from $29 per month for the Basic Shopify plan to $299 per month for the Advanced Shopify plan.
- **No Transaction Fees for POS**: If not using Shopify Payments, there are no additional fees for transactions processed outside Shopify’s payment system.
- **Hardware Costs**: Shopify also requires specific hardware for optimal use, which can be purchased directly through Shopify or via third-party providers compatible with their system.

### Revised Recommendation

Given that you will not be using the POS system for payment processing:

- **Square POS** might be a more cost-effective solution, particularly if you opt for the basic or standard retail package, as it offers robust POS functionalities without the need for transaction fees. This choice allows flexibility in choosing only the features you need without committing to a higher monthly fee.
- **Shopify POS** still offers strong inventory and sales management features but might be more expensive in the long run due to its subscription-based model. It would be most beneficial if you plan to integrate or shift your online operations to Shopify entirely in the future.

Ultimately, your choice might lean towards Square if the primary goal is to have a simple and efficient register system without additional transaction costs. However, if you foresee a need for deeper integration between your in-store and online operations, or you're planning on expanding the e-commerce aspect significantly, Shopify could justify the extra cost with its integrated capabilities and broader e-commerce support.

can you go and find out if we would be allowed to process our payments seperate to square and shopify, or if that goes against their TOS

ChatGPT

ChatGPT

Both Square and Shopify POS systems allow the use of external payment processors alongside their services.

For **Square**, the platform's documentation confirms that businesses can process payments externally and still use Square for recording such transactions. You simply need to record the external payment details using Square's API for bookkeeping purposes, but the financial transactions themselves do not pass through Square's system.

Similarly, **Shopify** allows its users to integrate with various payment gateways and processors. While Shopify has its own payment system, Shopify Payments, you are not restricted to using it exclusively. You can choose from a wide range of integrated payment gateways listed in their documentation, allowing flexibility in how you handle transactions financially while still using Shopify for managing your sales [[data]] and inventory.

This flexibility is especially useful for businesses that have pre-established relationships with banks or specific payment processors or need to comply with local financial regulations that might favor certain payment methods. Both systems support this operational flexibility, allowing you to select the best payment processing solution that suits your business needs while maintaining the use of their POS functionalities.
