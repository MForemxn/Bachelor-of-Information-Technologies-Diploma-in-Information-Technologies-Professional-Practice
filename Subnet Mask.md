# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
A subnet mask, used with logical AND operations and [[prefix length]], segments IP addresses into network and host parts for efficient networking.

# OVERVIEW:
A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that divides an [[IP address]] into network and host components, crucial for efficient [[IP address]] management. It is expressed in dot-decimal notation, like 255.255.255.0, and in binary form, it consists of consecutive ones (1s) followed by zeros (0s). The ones represent the network portion, while the zeros represent the host portion. Logical AND operations are used to determine the network address by comparing the [[IP address]] and subnet mask bit by bit. The [[prefix length]], denoted as a slash followed by a number (e.g., /24), indicates the number of bits set to one in the subnet mask. This notation simplifies understanding and configuring networks. Subnetting allows for creating multiple logical networks within a single physical network, optimizing performance, enhancing [[security]], and managing [[IP address]] allocation effectively.
