## 4. Project Design and Implementation Details

### Network Topology

- Branch network using 192.168.0.0/24 address range
- HQ network using 172.10.0.0/24 address range
- Multiple VLANs (10, 20, 99) for network segmentation
- Interconnected through OSPF Area 0

### Key Implementation Strategies

#### IP Addressing

- Utilized VLSM to maximize address space efficiency
- Allocated addresses considering host requirements:
    - Branch LAN-A (VLAN 10): 25 hosts
    - Branch LAN-A (VLAN 20): 35 hosts
    - Branch LAN-A (VLAN 99): 4 management hosts
    - Branch LAN-B: 4 hosts
    - HQ LAN-C: 10 hosts
    - HQ LAN-D: 100 hosts

#### Routing

- OSPF Process ID: 10
- Router IDs strategically assigned
    - R1: 9.9.9.9
    - R2: 8.8.8.8
    - R3: 7.7.7.7
- R1 configured with highest OSPF priority as designated router

#### Security Implementations

- SSH enabled on R3
- Named ACLs to control access
- VTY line access restricted
- Wireless network secured with WPA2 and AES encryption

#### NAT Configuration

- Static NAT for Host D translation
- Dynamic PAT for Branch network internet access
- NAT pool: 209.165.200.226-209.165.200.227

#### DHCP Configuration

- DHCP server on R4
- Separate pools for Branch and HQ networks
- First 5 host addresses in each pool excluded

#### Wireless Network

- SSID: LANE
- 2.4GHz band
- 100 maximum users
- Secured with WPA2/AES

## 5. Discussion and Troubleshooting

### Challenges Encountered

- Efficient address space allocation
- Ensuring proper routing between different network segments
- Implementing secure yet accessible network design

### Solutions Developed

- Careful VLSM subnetting to maximize address efficiency
- Strategic OSPF configuration for robust routing
- Comprehensive ACL implementation for granular access control

### Lessons Learned

- Importance of detailed network planning
- Need for flexible addressing schemes
- Critical role of security in network design

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrated advanced networking concepts, implementing a secure, scalable, and efficient network infrastructure across branch and headquarters locations.
