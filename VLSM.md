# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Variable Length [[Subnet]] Masking (VLSM) allows for more efficient [[IP address]] allocation by using different [[subnet]] masks within the same network.

# OVERVIEW:
Variable Length [[Subnet]] Masking (VLSM) is a technique used in IP networking to optimize the allocation of IP addresses by allowing subnets of varying sizes within the same network. Unlike traditional subnetting, which uses a fixed [[subnet mask]] for all subnets, VLSM enables network administrators to assign [[subnet]] masks based on the specific needs of each [[subnet]]. This [[flexibility]] helps in conserving IP addresses and reducing wastage, especially in networks with diverse requirements. VLSM is particularly useful in hierarchical network designs, where different segments may require different numbers of IP addresses. It is supported by classless [[routing]] protocols such as [[OSPF]], [[EIGRP]], and BGP, which can handle the complexity of varying [[subnet]] masks. By allowing more precise control over [[IP address]] distribution, VLSM enhances network efficiency and [[scalability]], making it an essential tool for modern network management.
