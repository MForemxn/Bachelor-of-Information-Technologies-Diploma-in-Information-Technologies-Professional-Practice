## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a [[database]] table, ensuring [[data]] [[integrity]] and efficient retrieval.

## OVERVIEW:
Primary [[keys]] are fundamental elements in relational [[database]] design, serving as unique identifiers for each record within a table. Each table can have only one primary key, which can consist of a single column or a combination of columns. The primary key ensures that each record is unique and can be efficiently retrieved, updated, or deleted. It also plays a crucial role in establishing relationships between tables, often being referenced by [[Foreign Keys]] in other tables. By enforcing uniqueness and non-null constraints, primary [[keys]] [[help]] maintain [[data]] [[integrity]] and prevent duplicate records. Proper use of primary [[keys]] is essential for optimising [[database]] performance and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of [[data]].

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Unique identifier for each table record.
2. Ensures [[data]] [[integrity]] and uniqueness.
3. Can be a single column or combination.
4. Only one primary key per table.
5. Facilitates efficient [[data]] retrieval.
6. Prevents duplicate records.
7. Enforces non-null constraints.
8. Essential for relational [[database]] design.
9. Often referenced by [[foreign keys]].
10. Optimises [[database]] performance.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Primary [[keys]] uniquely identify table records.
2. They ensure [[data]] [[integrity]] and prevent duplicates.
3. Only one primary key is allowed per table.
4. Facilitate efficient [[data]] operations and retrieval.
5. Crucial for establishing table relationships and optimising performance.
