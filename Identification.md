## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Identification in computer [[security]] involves verifying the identity of users or systems to ensure secure access and prevent unauthorized activities.

## OVERVIEW:
Identification in computer [[security]] is a critical [[process]] that involves verifying the identity of users, devices, or systems to ensure that only authorized [[entities]] can access sensitive information and resources. This [[process]] is fundamental to maintaining the [[integrity]], [[confidentiality]], and [[availability]] of [[data]] within an organization. Identification typically involves the use of credentials such as usernames, passwords, [[biometric]] [[data]], or digital certificates. Effective identification mechanisms are essential for implementing robust access control policies, detecting and preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. The [[process]] also plays a crucial role in auditing and monitoring activities, helping to trace actions back to specific users or systems. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the methods and technologies used for identification must also advance to address new challenges and vulnerabilities.
