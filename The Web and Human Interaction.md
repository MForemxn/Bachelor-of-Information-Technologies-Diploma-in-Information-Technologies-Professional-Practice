### The Web

- The web is essentially a network of computers, where a "big computer" hosts a website, running a web server program on an operating system, which in turn runs on hardware.

### Web Servers

- Web servers are programs that accept requests from browsers via a network connection and return content, such as HTML pages or other [[data]]. This process involves an HTTP request from the browser, which the server responds to by sending the requested content back to the browser.

### Web Content Management

- While web servers typically serve static web pages from files (e.g., `index.html`), content can also be dynamically generated through programming languages like PHP or ASP.NET. Large websites may use Content Management Systems (CMS) like Joomla, Drupal, or WordPress to manage content automatically.

### [[Web Page Development]]

- Web pages consist of text and markup, including HTML (Hyper-text Markup Language) for structuring content and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for presentation. HTML structures text into various elements like headings, lists, paragraphs, and tables. Browsers interpret these elements to display the content appropriately.

### HTML and Web Pages

- Web pages are plain [[text files]] containing text and markup (tags) that browsers use to render the content visually. Web pages use hyperlinks to link to other pages, creating a network of interconnected content. The document mentions different "dialects" of HTML, including HTML 4.0 Transitional, HTML Strict, XHTML, and HTML5.

### Web Browsers

- Each web browser has an HTML viewer, or "engine," that interprets HTML documents. The document lists several browser engines, including WebKit (Blink), Trident (Edge), and Gecko. It also provides browser usage statistics, highlighting the dominance of Chrome and the importance of testing web content across multiple browsers and devices due to rendering differences.

### Design and Testing

- The importance of good web design is emphasised, with references to resources for learning HTML, CSS, and web design principles. The document suggests testing web pages at different resolutions and across browsers to ensure compatibility and optimal user experience.

### The Assignment

- A brief mention of an assignment related to the course content, including specifications, examples, and peer marking. It suggests checking the web page design at a resolution of 1024x768 and testing on browsers with different engines, specifically Firefox and Chrome/Safari.

This summary encapsulates the main themes and educational content of the document related to [[Web Systems]], focusing on the technical foundations of web servers, [[web page development]], browser diversity, and web design principles.
