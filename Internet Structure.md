## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The network edge consists of hosts like clients and servers, access networks use wired and wireless links, and the network core comprises interconnected routers forming a network of networks.

## OVERVIEW:
The network edge includes hosts, which are primarily clients and servers. Servers are often located in data centres to provide robust and scalable services. Access networks and physical media facilitate communication between these hosts through wired and wireless links. The network core is made up of interconnected routers that form a complex network of networks, ensuring data can travel efficiently from one host to another across various paths and infrastructures.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Network edge includes hosts.
2. Hosts are clients and servers.
3. Servers are often in data centres.
4. Access networks use wired links.
5. Access networks use wireless links.
6. Network core consists of interconnected routers.
7. Routers form a network of networks.
8. Data travels efficiently through the network core.
9. Communication links connect hosts.
10. Physical media includes both wired and wireless.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Hosts at the network edge are crucial for client-server interactions.
2. Data centres house servers for enhanced service delivery.
3. Wired and wireless links are essential for access networks.
4. Interconnected routers in the network core ensure efficient data routing.
5. The network core's complexity supports robust and scalable communication.
