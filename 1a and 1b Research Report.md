# Investigation Scope: Waste Management: 1.4 Waste as a Resource

> How can we effectively determine the different sources of waste on pacific islands such as Saibai, and how can we best adjust the flow of waste through communities to divert waste away from landfill?

# Research/Structure
## Understanding the Context and Challenges of Waste Management in Remote Areas:
> What are the specific challenges associated with centralised waste collection and disposal in remote areas like Saibai?
> How does the geographic isolation and limited infrastructure impact waste management practices and options?
- geographic isolation: lack of transportation infrastructure, costly to move waste
- limited resources: limited financial resources and manpower
- climate vulnerability: saibai is prone to natural disasters, and therefore is prone to environmental contamination from poor waste management infrastructure
- health risks: the relocating of waste may lead to the spread of disease
- technological limitations: remote areas such as saibai do not have access to the technology required to create waste processing plants such as the ones that exist in modern, western countries. 
## Exploring Recycling and Upcycling Opportunities for Common Waste Items:
> What are the most common forms of waste found on Country, particularly on Saibai's shorelines?
> How can these common waste items be repurposed or recycled to minimise environmental impact and create value?
- ghost nets and microplastics are the most common types of waste to be found on the shores of Saibai. 
	- ghost nets: discarded fishing nets which drift through oceans and entangle natural sea life. 
		- can be repurposed into:
			- material for creating artistic sculptures, baskets, or mats
			- recycled into nylon pellets for the manufacturing of clothing
			- used in construction projects to reinforce concrete
			- used to create eco-friendly building materials.
	- microplastics: tiny pieces of plastics which are created from decomposing plastic consumables in oceans, which are consumed by fish. 
		- can be repurposed into:
			- new plastic products
			- transformed into fuel
			- material use in local manufacturing or craft industries. 
## Case Studies of Small-Scale Recycling Initiatives:
> What examples exist of successful small-scale recycling initiatives implemented in remote or island communities?
> How have these initiatives addressed logistical challenges and created sustainable waste management solutions?
- Tetiaroa Society Recycling Program in French Polynesia
	- focuses on collecting and recycling plastic waste generated within their own community, including efforts such as beach cleanups and community education programs
	- recycled materials are shipped elsewhere to be processed and recycled into a new purpose
- Haa Dhaalu Atoll Waste Management Project in the Maldives
	- implemented by the government in collaboration with local not for profits
	- specific activities include:
		- community based recycling programs
		- waste segregation and seperation
		- composting of organic waste
	- the materials are then shipped to neighbouring islands for use, or to the mainland for further processing
- these initiatives have addressed local challenges through:
	- creating a tighter-knit community
	- educating the community
	- developing underlying infastructure
	- developing partnerships with external governments and NGO's
	- collaborating with innovators in the chosen field allow for passion and funding from large groups of people to be funnelled into projects. 
## Innovative Approaches to Recycling Outputs and By-Products:
> What innovative technologies or [[processes]] exist for managing the outputs or by-products of recycling [[processes]]?
> How can recycled materials be further transformed or utilised to maximise their value and minimise waste?
- there are three key new technologies used to improve the quality of the recycling process. these include
	- pyrolysis: thermal decomposition of organic materials in an oxygen free environment. this can be used to convert non-recyclable plastics, organic waste, and rubber into things like biofuels, carbon black, snd syngas. 
	- chemical recycling: breaks down plastic compounds into their individual monomers or chemical compounds. this can be used to refine plastic waste into new plastics, chemicals, or fuels.
	- bioremediation: uses microorganisms to break down organic compounds within waste materials, such as in oil spills or polluted soils. this process separates the waste from natural material, and can be used to seperate waste from natural material, which in turn reduces environmental pollution and improves the rate of resource recovery from soils and other natural material. 
- recycled materials can be further refined and transformed to increase their value to the community. this can be done through
	- Upcycling: transforming waste material into functional or aesthetic appealing objects which have higher value to society. this can include repurposing plastics and bottles into clothing, art, furniture, or accessories, which increase their value to society without over processing it. 
	- closed loop manufacturing: aims to create a no waste output economy where all waste is used to create something new. this means there is no waste output, and no raw material input, which helps the environment at every stage of the process. this is done through recycled materials being incorporated into the manufacturing of new products. 
	- resource recovery: the process of removing valuable materials and resources from other items. this includes:
		- precious metals like gold and silver being reclaimed from electronic waste
## Community Engagement and Participation:
> How can local communities be actively involved in recycling and upcycling initiatives on Saibai?
> What strategies can be implemented to raise awareness and promote participation in waste reduction efforts?
- communities can be involved in the recycling process on Saibai island through:
	- community workshops and training programs: educating the community on the importance of effective waste management and upcycling where possible
	- community led recycling centres: building self sustaining centres where people can volunteer to [[help]] in sorting and processing activities
	- incentive programs: provide incentives to [[help]] convince members of the community that their participation in recycling and waste management is not only valued, but necessary. 
- there are many ways to raise awareness for the importance of effective waste management. this includes:
	- public education campaigns
	- school programs
	- community events and festivals
	- partnerships and collaboration
- by actively involving the community in the waste management process, the involvement of other organisations becomes obsolete, and Saibai becomes a better, more self sustaining society. 
## Economic Viability and Sustainability:
> What are the economic implications of implementing recycling and upcycling initiatives in remote areas like Saibai?
> How can these initiatives be made financially sustainable and contribute to local economic development?
- **economic** implications:
	- initial investment costs high
	- operational expenses
	- market demand and pricing
- **how these could be managed**
	- value added products and services
	- partnerships and collaborations
	- community engagement and employment opportunities 
	- policy support and incentives
- any of these strategies could be employed in order to mitigate the economic implications of setting up effective waste management on the island of Saibai.
- this being said, all of the aforementioned programs would require significant investment from more developed countries, as even with all of the mitigating strategies, the economy of Saibai island is just not strong enough to undergo such a radical infrastructure project. 
## Environmental and Social Impact Assessment:
> What are the potential environmental benefits and drawbacks of recycling and upcycling common waste items on Country?
> How can these initiatives contribute to community well-being and resilience in the face of environmental challenges?
- potential **benefits** of upcycling:
	- natural resource conservation
	- waste reduction
	- pollution prevention
- potential **drawbacks**
	- energy and resource intense operations
	- contamination and quality issues
	- economic viability
- this being said, the benefits of these ideas on community wellbeing would also be large. this is due to the protection of Saibai as a whole, which would ensure the local residents aren't forced out of their homes. these include:
	- environmental health and safety
	- economic opportunities and livelihoods
	- social cohesion and community engagement
	- cultural preservation and identity. 
## Policy and Regulatory Considerations:
> What policy frameworks and regulations govern waste management and recycling efforts in remote areas like Saibai?
> What changes or adaptations may be necessary to support and incentivise recycling and upcycling initiatives?
- the main policies and regulations governing waste management are:
	- national legislation
	- regional and local regulations
	- international agreements and treaties
- changes needed to support recycling and upcycling
	- policy alignment and intergration
	- financial incentives and subsidies
	- capacity building and technical assistance
	- public awareness and education
	- stakeholder engagement and collaboration
## Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing:
> How can partnerships with government agencies, NGOs, academic institutions, and industry stakeholders facilitate the implementation and success of recycling and upcycling projects on Saibai?
> What opportunities exist for sharing knowledge and best practices with other communities facing similar waste management challenges?
- how partnerships can [[help]] facilitate the implementation and success of these projects:
	- government agencies: provide support, funding, and technical expertise
	- ngo's: community engagement, capacity building, and create education programs
	- academic institutions: conduct research and provide scientific expertise, offer training, research opportunities, provide opportunities for practical experience
	- industry stakeholders: provide monetary (financial) resources to [[help]] make these plans and infrastructure upgrades happen, and to keep them running for years to come.
