Throughout your time at UTS you are going to have to contact staff via email many times. Staff will not be able to respond instantly to queries so long email chains back and forth are going to slow down the resolution of your queries. Therefore it is vital you provide all relevant information in the first instance, ensuring staff can respond quickly and won't need to ask for further information.

**It is UTS policy that you must use your student email address to contact staff. Staff are unable to confirm it is you if you use a personal address.**

## Details to include in an email

- A short description of your query in the subject field (3-5 words)
- Your Student ID
- The subject code and/or name you are enquiring about
- If your email is not a simple general enquiry, then your tutorial activity number should be provided to help us find your information
- All relevant context to your enquiry

## Tips for emailing

1. **Try to find answers yourself first, it'll be quicker**  
    For 90% of queries, the answer is on Canvas
2. **Ensure you are aware of relevant policies in regards to your query**  
    For instance, there is a procedure to follow for [querying your marks](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/managing-your-course/classes-and-assessment/results/query-mark-or-grade), not following it will delay resolution of your enquiry
3. **Be professional and read your email before sending**  
    Incomprehensible language, missing details, or rudeness will delay resolution of your enquiry  
    Email is not instant messaging
4. **Setup an automatic signature with your details**  
    It is easy to forget to include your student ID, subject codes, and tutorial numbers, if you add them to [a signature that gets added to all emailsLinks to an external site.](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=outlook+online+setup+email+signature) you will never forget!
