# Introduction
An effective design proposal can succinctly communicate a creative process to its intended audience. Throughout the proposal, various project specifications and objectives for the proposed design solution are elaborated upon. The aim of this report is to convince EWB to authorise the continuation of this design process.  
The 2018 EWB Challenge program is focused on the community development and resource management throughout three adjacent communities: Ksach Leav, Koh Khnear, and Puntha Chea. During the research phase of the EWB Challenge, valuable information about the Kratie Province was attained. Through an examination of this crucial content, an appropriate design area was chosen with several potential programs that aim to improve the local communities’ quality of life. Ultimately, this proposal will suggest a design solution that is the most practical and beneficial for the Cambodian people.

## 1.1 Background  Target Community – Kratie Province

Located in eastern Cambodia, the Kratie Province is situated around 140kms of the Mekong River. The villages of Ksach Leav, Koh Khnear and Puntha Chea all lie on the banks of the Mekong River in the Sambour District, approximately 74kms north of Kratie Town Centre. The Mekong River provides both food and, while also acting as a source of income from fishing and wet rice farming. Each village is connected to each other by flat dirt roads. Ksach Leav is the central location for surrounding villages, containing markets and both a primary and secondary school. (Engineering Without Borders Challenge 2018) Sanitation and Hygiene Problems in Cambodia

Access to clean water and a lack of sanitary resources are some of the main problems affecting Cambodia, especially within rural communities. Although the EWB Challenge Communities are located along on the Mekong, where water supply is fairly constant, villages still lack the resources to achieve effective sanitation methods. A study by Jacobs and Roberts (Jacobs & Roberts 2004) stated that “handwashing before preparing food was fairly universally practiced but not after defecating.” With open defecation accounting for the majority of diseases transmitted in rural Cambodia, (World Bank 2008), improvement of hygiene practices such as correct hand washing technique will improve the overall health of the villages. It can also create economic benefits for the villages due to less money spent on healthcare, an influx in western tourists who have been scared of the abundance of diseases in rural Cambodia and less ‘sick days’ enabling people to work more.

## Education rates in Cambodia

Education is essential for the growth of society, both economically and socially. After the abolishment of schooling during the Khmer Rouge Regime, the education system in Cambodia continues to rebuild to this day. Statistics show that in 2015, enrolment into tertiary education for males and females was 14.39 percent and 11.81 percent respectively. Primary schooling on the other hand has a high enrolment rate of 95.2 percent. (UNICEF 2018) Reasons for such low enrolment is due to poverty and the high education cost. But with an increase in education, there would be a reduction in poverty, increased income and economic growth. Targeting the education system, particularly primary education due to the high enrolment rate, to teach the importance of proper hand hygiene and other related sanitation practices would have an enormous effect on the current sanitation problems within Cambodia as it would enable those practices to be taught from a young age and continued over the children’s lives.

## 1.2 EWB Challenge Design Opportunity

An analysis of the background research summaries uncovered severe problems with hygiene and sanitation within the EWB Challenge communities. Various harmful diseases are prevalent within the Kratie Province due to the limited amount of materials and equipment available to implement common hygiene practices (Hancart-Petitet et al. 2011).

Design Area 2 is a significant problem section that needs to be addressed because of its potential to improve the quality of life for Cambodians in the EWB Challenge communities. Consequently, the implementation of a practical school handwashing program will contribute to a decline in bacterial and viral diseases.

An effective design solution needs to be able to carry out its intended function successfully. Therefore, for the school handwashing program to be beneficial it requires students to understand and learn the significance of its message. With this information, the expectation is that these children will begin to bring those hand washing practices into their households. The measurable objective of success for our design solution is a decline of preventable diseases amongst the Kratie Province population.

Primary schools are the greatest opportunity to influence children within the EWB Challenge communities.

The project is only based upon improving hand sanitation practice and education within primary schools. Through limiting the scope of the design solution, it is believed that the program can be more effectively implemented and monitored for future improvement.
