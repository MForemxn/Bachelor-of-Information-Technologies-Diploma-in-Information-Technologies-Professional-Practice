# What is Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)?
- Multiprotocol Label Switching, or MPLS, is a data-carrying technique for high-performance telecommunications networks.
- MPLS directs data from one network node to the next based on short path labels rather than long network addresses, avoiding complex lookups in a routing table.
- It integrates the performance and traffic-management capabilities of data link Layer 2 with the scalability and flexibility of network Layer 3 routing.

# How MPLS Works
- In MPLS networks, data packets are assigned labels.
- Packet-forwarding decisions are made solely on the contents of this label, without the need to examine the packet itself.
- This allows for the creation of end-to-end circuits across any type of transport medium, using any protocol.
- The labeled packets are forwarded along a path of routers (label switch routers or LSRs), each of which makes forwarding decisions based solely on the contents of the label.
- At each hop, the LSR strips off the existing label and applies a new label which tells the next hop how to forward the packet.

# Benefits of MPLS
- **Efficiency**: MPLS increases routing efficiency and enhances traffic management by allowing for the setting of predetermined, optimized paths for traffic.
- **Quality of Service (QoS)**: It supports multiple levels of service, enabling prioritization of voice, video, and data traffic.
- **Scalability**: MPLS can easily scale to handle high volumes of traffic and more customers.
- **Flexibility**: It supports IP, ATM, and frame relay Layer 2 protocols, making it flexible for integrating and supporting varied networking technologies.
- **Reliability**: MPLS offers improved network redundancy, allowing for the rerouting of traffic in case of a node or link failure, thus increasing network reliability and [[availability]].

# MPLS Applications
- **VPN Services**: MPLS is widely used for deploying Virtual Private Network (VPN) services for connecting multiple sites in an enterprise network or connecting customer sites for service providers.
- **Traffic Engineering**: By directing and controlling data paths, MPLS facilitates traffic engineering, optimizing network resources and performance.
- **Quality of Service (QoS)**: MPLS allows for the definition of QoS policies for different types of traffic, ensuring that critical services like VoIP and streaming media are given higher priority over less time-sensitive applications.
- **Layer 2 Services**: MPLS can be used to provide Layer 2 services like Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), allowing for the creation of a virtualized Ethernet LAN service over a wide area network.

# MPLS vs. Traditional IP Routing
- **Speed**: MPLS can provide faster packet forwarding because the fixed-length label is easier and quicker for a router to process than a complex network address.
- **Flexibility and Scalability**: Unlike traditional IP routing, MPLS allows for dynamic path adjustment in response to real-time traffic and bandwidth conditions, offering greater flexibility and scalability.
- **Quality of Service**: MPLS offers superior Quality of Service options, as it can set traffic priorities and engineer the network for optimal performance of critical applications, something that is more challenging with conventional IP routing.
