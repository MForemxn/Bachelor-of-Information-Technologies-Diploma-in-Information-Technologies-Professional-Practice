# Understanding Intrusive Behaviour
Intrusive behaviour in [[cybersecurity]] refers to unauthorized actions aimed at compromising the [[integrity]], [[confidentiality]], or [[availability]] of [[information systems]]. It is crucial to understand the nature of these behaviours to effectively defend against them.

## What is Intrusion
Intrusion involves any unauthorized access or activity within a computer system or network. It can lead to [[data]] breaches, system damage, or service disruptions. Understanding intrusion is essential for developing effective [[security]] measures.

## Classes of Intruders (Cyber Criminals)
Cyber criminals can be categorized based on their motives and methods. They exploit vulnerabilities to achieve their goals, which can range from financial gain to political influence.

### [[State]]-Sponsored Organisation
These are groups funded by governments to conduct cyber espionage or sabotage. They possess significant resources and expertise, making them formidable adversaries.

### Activists
Activists, or hacktivists, use cyber attacks to promote political agendas or social change. Their actions are often driven by ideology rather than financial gain.

# Intrusion Detection System ([[IDS]])
An [[IDS]] is a [[security]] solution designed to detect unauthorized access or anomalies within a network. It plays a critical role in identifying potential threats and alerting administrators.

## Sensor (Agent)
Sensors are components of an [[IDS]] that collect [[data]] from various sources within a network. They monitor traffic and system activities to identify suspicious patterns.

## Analyser (Detector)
The analyser [[processes]] [[data]] collected by sensors to detect potential intrusions. It uses algorithms to identify anomalies or known attack signatures.

## [[Decision]] Engine
The [[decision]] engine evaluates the findings of the analyser and determines the appropriate response. It can trigger alerts or initiate automated defence mechanisms.

# Anomaly/Behaviour-based and Signature-based Schemes
These are two primary methods used in [[IDS]]. Anomaly-based schemes detect deviations from normal behaviour, while signature-based schemes identify known attack patterns.

# Host-based and Network-based [[IDS]]/[[IPS]]
Host-based systems monitor individual devices, while network-based systems oversee entire network traffic. Both approaches have unique advantages and limitations.

# Commercial [[IDS]]/[[IPS]]
Commercial [[IDS]]/[[IPS]] solutions are developed by vendors to provide comprehensive [[security]] features. They offer user-friendly interfaces and regular updates to address emerging threats.

# Measuring Effectiveness of [[IDS]] Schemes
Effectiveness is measured by the system's ability to accurately detect intrusions while minimizing false positives. Performance metrics and testing are essential for evaluation.

# Honeypots
Honeypots are decoy systems designed to attract and study attackers. They provide valuable insights into attack methods and [[help]] improve [[security]] strategies.
