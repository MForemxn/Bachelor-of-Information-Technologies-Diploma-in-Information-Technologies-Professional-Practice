## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, enabling devices to locate and communicate with each other over [[the internet]].

## OVERVIEW:
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralised naming system used to resolve human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1). This translation is crucial for internet functionality, as it allows users to access websites and services using easy-to-remember names instead of numerical IP addresses. DNS operates through a distributed [[database]] maintained by a network of DNS servers. When a user enters a domain name into their browser, a DNS query is initiated, which traverses through various DNS servers (recursive resolvers, root servers, top-level domain servers, and authoritative name servers) to find the corresponding IP address. DNS also supports other functions, such as email routing and service discovery, through various record types like A (address), MX (mail exchange), CNAME (canonical name), and TXT (text). DNS [[security]] extensions (DNSSEC) add an additional layer of [[security]] by ensuring the authenticity and [[integrity]] of DNS [[data]].

## MAIN POINTS:
1. DNS translates domain names into IP addresses.
2. Enables easy access to websites and services.
3. Operates through a hierarchical, distributed [[database]].
4. DNS queries traverse multiple servers to resolve names.
5. Recursive resolvers, root servers, TLD servers, and authoritative servers are involved.
6. Supports email routing and service discovery.
7. Common DNS record types: A, MX, CNAME, TXT.
8. DNSSEC ensures authenticity and [[integrity]] of DNS [[data]].
9. Essential for internet functionality and navigation.
10. Facilitates seamless communication between devices.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. DNS translates human-readable names to IP addresses for internet communication.
2. Operates through a hierarchical network of DNS servers.
3. Supports various functions with different record types.
4. DNSSEC enhances [[security]] by verifying DNS [[data]].
5. Crucial for seamless internet navigation and service access.
