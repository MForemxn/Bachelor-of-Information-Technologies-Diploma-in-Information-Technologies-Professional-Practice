[[Class]]
[[Inheritance]]
[[Polymorphism]]

# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Classes, [[inheritance]], and [[polymorphism]] are fundamental [[object]]-oriented programming concepts that enable [[code reusability]], hierarchy creation, and dynamic behavior in [[software development]].

# OVERVIEW:
In [[object]]-oriented programming (OOP), classes, [[inheritance]], and [[polymorphism]] are key concepts that facilitate efficient and modular code design. A [[class]] is a blueprint for creating objects, encapsulating [[data]] and methods that operate on that [[data]]. [[Inheritance]] allows a new [[class]], known as a subclass, to inherit [[attributes]] and methods from an existing [[class]], called a [[superclass]], promoting [[code reuse]] and hierarchical relationships. [[Polymorphism]] enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent [[class]], allowing for dynamic method invocation and [[flexibility]] in [[code execution]]. This is achieved through method overriding and interfaces, where different classes can implement the same method in various ways. Together, these concepts enhance software maintainability, [[scalability]], and [[flexibility]], making it easier to manage complex systems and implement changes without affecting existing code structures.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Classes define blueprints for creating objects.
2. [[Inheritance]] allows subclasses to inherit from superclasses.
3. Promotes [[code reuse]] and hierarchical relationships.
4. [[Polymorphism]] enables dynamic method invocation.
5. Allows objects to be treated as parent [[class]] instances.
6. Achieved through method overriding and interfaces.
7. Enhances software maintainability and [[scalability]].
8. Facilitates flexible and modular code design.
9. Simplifies management of complex systems.
10. Supports implementing changes without affecting existing code.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Classes, [[inheritance]], and [[polymorphism]] are core OOP concepts.
2. They promote [[code reusability]] and [[flexibility]].
3. [[Inheritance]] creates hierarchical relationships between classes.
4. [[Polymorphism]] allows dynamic and flexible [[code execution]].
5. Essential for maintaining and scaling complex software systems.
