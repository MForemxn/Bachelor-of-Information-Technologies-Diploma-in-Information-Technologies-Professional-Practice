Additional information

U:PASS Program

This subject participates the UTS Peer Assisted Study Success (U:PASS) this session. You are encouraged to sign in

this program.

U:PASS is a voluntary “study session” where you will be studying the subject with other students in a group. It is led by

a student who has previously achieved a distinction or high distinction in that subject, and who has a good WAM. The

leader will typically prepare questions for you to work on, or if you have specific questions or things you’re not clear

29/07/2024 (Spring 2024) © University of Technology Sydney Page 6 of 14leader will typically prepare questions for you to work on, or if you have specific questions or things you’re not clear

on, you can bring them along, and the leader will get the group to work on that. It’s really relaxed, friendly, and

informal. Because the leader is a student just like you, they understand what it’s like to study the subject and how to

do well, and they can pass those tips along to you. Students also say it’s a great way to meet new people and a

“guaranteed study hour”.

You can sign up for U:PASS sessions U:PASS website http://tinyurl.com/upass2017. Note that sign up is not open

until week 2, as it’s voluntary and only students who want to go should sign up.

Note that you don’t have to be struggling in the subject to attend U:PASS – frequently students who are already doing

well will do even better after attending U:PASS.

If you have any questions or concerns about U:PASS, please contact Georgina at upass@uts.edu.au, or check out

the website: http://www.ssu.uts.edu.au/peerlearning/index.html

Assessment: faculty procedures and advice

Marking criteria

Marking criteria for each assessment task will be available on the Learning Management System: Canvas.

Extensions

When, due to extenuating circumstances, you are unable to submit or present an assessment task on time, please

contact your subject coordinator before the assessment task is due to discuss an extension. Extensions may be

granted up to a maximum of 5 days (120 hours) for standard students or up to a maximum of 7 days (168 hours) for

UTS Online students. In all cases you should have extensions confirmed in writing.

Special consideration

If you believe your performance in an assessment item or exam has been adversely affected by circumstances

beyond your control, such as a serious illness, loss or bereavement, hardship, trauma, or exceptional employment

demands, you may be eligible to apply for Special Consideration.

Late penalty

For Graded [[subjects]]:

Work submitted late without an approved extension is subject to a late penalty of 10 per cent of the total available

marks deducted per calendar day that the assessment is overdue (e.g. if an assignment is out of 40 marks, and is

submitted (up to) 24 hours after the deadline without an extension, the student will have four marks deducted from

their awarded mark). Work submitted after five calendar days is not accepted and a mark of zero is awarded.

For some assessment tasks a late penalty may not be appropriate – these are clearly indicated in the subject outline.

Such assessments receive a mark of zero if not completed by/on the specified date. Examples include:

a.

b.

c.

weekly online tests or laboratory work worth a small proportion of the subject mark, or

online quizzes where answers are released to students on completion, or

professional assessment tasks, where the intention is to create an authentic assessment that has an absolute

submission date, or

d.

e.

take-[[home]] papers that are assessed during a defined time period, or

pass/fail assessment tasks.

For Pass/Fail [[subjects]]:

Work submitted late without an approved extension will only be assessed at the subject coordinator’s discretion.

Students who do not submit assessment tasks by the due dates may be referred to the Responsible Academic Officer

under Student Rule 3.8.2, and a fail result may be recorded for the subject.

Request a review of a result

If you believe an error may have been made in the calculation of your result in an assessment task or the final result

for the subject, it is possible to request a review of a result with the Subject Coordinator within five (5) working days of

the date of release of the result.

Academic [[integrity]]

Academic [[integrity]] is about demonstrating honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility in your studies and

assessments. Studying at UTS and being part of our community means maintaining these values and acting with

academic [[integrity]] at all times. This is in line with expectations for professional practice in Engineering and IT.

Guide to practising academic [[integrity]]

As a UTS student, when you create something original, credit others and collaborate with care, you act with academic

[[integrity]]:

Create something original. This means doing all your own work from start to finish, submitting work that is original

for that assessment and being honest about any [[data]] or results.

Credit others. You need to acknowledge and reference the source of any ideas, [[data]] or materials you use or adapt

Generative [[AI]] (GenAI) and academic [[integrity]]

In the Faculty of Engineering and IT [[subjects]], unless otherwise instructed by the Subject Coordinator, you are

permitted to use [[AI]] technologies, such as ChatGPT or DALL-E, to generate materials for background research and

self-study. Only assistive use is permitted. Content generated by [[AI]] technologies or other sources presented as your

own work is considered to be academic misconduct as per the UTS Student Rules on misconduct.

There are a few things you must do to ensure you are maintaining academic [[integrity]]:

Check the rules for if and how you can use GenAI in your [[subjects]] and assessments via this subject outline or your

subject sites in Canvas (rules will differ between [[subjects]], so make sure you check each subject). If you are not

sure, check with your tutor, lecturer or subject coordinator.

Understand how to use GenAI ethically.

Unless instructed otherwise by the Subject Coordinator, reference and acknowledge the use of GenAI in your work,

providing details of the type of interactions and extent of usage.

Academic [[integrity]] breaches

A breach of academic [[integrity]] is also known as 'academic misconduct'. A breach occurs if you engage in behaviour

that undermines academic [[integrity]], such as plagiarism and cheating (see Student Rule 16.2).

Plagiarism can take a number of forms including but not limited to:

copying any section of text, no matter how brief, from a book, journal, article or other written source, such as coding,

without duly acknowledging the source.

copying any map, diagram, table or figure without duly acknowledging the source.

paraphrasing or otherwise using the ideas of another author without duly acknowledging the source.

re-using sections of verbatim text without using quote marks to indicate the text was copied from the source (even if

a reference is given).

Cheating includes, but is not limited to:

submitting work that is not your own, copying from another student, recycling another student's work, recycling

previously submitted work, and working with another student in the same cohort in a manner that exceeds the

boundaries of legitimate cooperation

purchasing an assignment from a website and submitting it as original work.

requesting or paying someone else to write original work, such as an assignment, essay or computer program, and

submitting it as original work.

manipulating an assessment to avoid the UTS detection software or using a third-party service to bypass the UTS

detection software.

using material or equipment that is not specified on an examination paper for use in the examination.

Students who allow their assessment to be copied, share their assessment on external platforms, or provide other

students with the answers to assessments are also subject to student misconduct Rules.

These are all serious forms of misconduct and penalties apply.

To [[help]] ensure academic [[integrity]], assessments that you submit electronically may be subject to similarity detection

software. Your work must be submitted in a format able to be assessed by the software (e.g. doc, pdf ([[text files]]), rtf,

html). Under the Coursework Assessments Policy (section 4.27), vivas or other invigilated tasks may be used to

confirm or clarify your work and/or marks, and to verify achievement of learning outcomes.

Academic liaison officer

Academic liaison officers (ALOs) are academic staff in each faculty who assist students experiencing difficulties in

their studies due to: disability and/or an ongoing health condition; carer responsibilities (e.g. being a primary carer for

small children or a family member with a disability); and pregnancy.

ALOs are responsible for approving adjustments to assessment arrangements for students in these categories.

Students who require adjustments due to disability and/or an ongoing health condition are requested to discuss their

situation with an accessibility consultant at the Accessibility Service before speaking to the relevant ALO.
