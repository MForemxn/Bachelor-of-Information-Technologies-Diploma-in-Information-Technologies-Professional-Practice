# Introduction
- Virtually all organisations are aware of the need to protect their businesses from cybercrime. But too many organisations are ill- prepared to deal with cyberattacks. **WHY**?
	- **Attitude** – (i) consider themselves not appealing target to cybercriminals, (ii) even consider [[cybersecurity]] irrelevant for their business, (iii) it is an IT problem and not a whole-of-business issue).
	- **Awareness** _- Lack of acute awareness and concern about the_ [[cybersecurity]] threat landscape, the _real risks and consequence._ **[[Cybersecurity]] program cost** – put in place basic [[cybersecurity]] program, which is often the target of budget cut.
	- **Corporate [[cybersecurity]] culture** – lack of [[security]]-minded culture and too many employees are still too naïve about [[cybersecurity]]
	- **Underestimating [[cybersecurity]]** - A false sense of [[security]].

# Response to [[Cybersecurity]] Incidents
- three main coping mechanisms for dealing with [[cybersecurity]] breaches
	- reactive solution: responding after suffering an attack
	- proactive solution: controls to detect potential threats before an incident occurs
	- hybrid: a blend of reactive and both, with detection and a [[Contingency Plan]]
# [[Cybersecurity]] [[Contingency Planning]]
- The only way to be sure that you can quickly handle unexpected events without significant business disruption is to make [[contingency planning]] a normal component of your business.
	- [[Contingency planning]] is a [[process]] for developing an orderly course of action designed to [[help]] respond effectively to natural or manmade events or situations such as the loss of [[data]] and other disruptive unknowns with very little inconvenience or loss of revenue in a cost efficient manner.
- Three important contingency plans are:
	- Incident response plan,
	- Disaster recovery plan,
	- Business continuity plan

## Benefits of [[Cybersecurity]] [[Contingency Planning]]
- lowers costs associated with [[cybersecurity]] incident investigation
	- planning acknowledges that [[cybersecurity]] incidents will occur, and aim to minimise impact
	- simplifies the tracing and investigation phase
- ensures any impact will not reach the critical level
- focuses on how organisations will respond when an unplanned incident disrupts the normal flow of the business
- ensures controls are in place and a plan of action for responding to incidents.
# [[Cybersecurity]] Incident Types
- Example of [[cybersecurity]] incidents include
	- Presence of unfamiliar files on systems
	- Presence of unknown programs & [[processes]] on systems
	- Employee loses a device (laptop, tablet, phone) holding sensitive company [[data]]
	- Unusual number of system crashes
	- Unusual consumption of system resources
	- Unexpected activities taking place at unusual times
# [[Cybersecurity]] Incident Response Plan
- A [[cybersecurity]] incident response management plan [[help]] organisations prepare for and respond to [[cybersecurity]] incidents quickly and efficiently.
	- A comprehensive set of [[processes]] and procedures that outlines the specific steps to manage [[cybersecurity]] incidents.
- Must be aligned with the business mission and vision
- People across the organisation should be involved in drafting the plan.
- Also, employees should be trained on the IR strategy specially how to detect and report [[cybersecurity]] incidents
## [[Cybersecurity]] Incident Response Plan Phases
- The basic critical building blocks of [[cybersecurity]] incident management [[process]] have six main phases
	- Preparing phase (i.e., preparing for a [[cybersecurity]] incident)
	- Detection phase
	- Containment phase
	- Eradication phase
	- Response phase
	- Post-incident phase
- During each phase, evidence is collected and properly maintained
### Preparing phase (i.e., preparing for a [[cybersecurity]] incident)
- This phase is performed to ensure that all response procedures are known, coordinated and systematically carried out
	- identifying critical assets that must be protected at all costs
	- selecting and implementing the right tools
	- setting up the right [[processes]] prior to an incident occurring.
	- revisiting and analysing previous incidents to guide planning
### Detection phase
- An incident is reported to the IRP team by
	- Employees of the organisation
	- Alerts raised by products (e.g., firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and [[data]] loss prevention).
	- Surveillance systems (e.g., video)
- The IRP team will verify if the incident is real (a valid attack) or not. An incident is considered a valid attack if
	- directed against organization’s asset (e.g. information asset),
	- has a realistic chance of success, and
	- threatens [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]] or [[availability]] breach
- For incidents deemed real, the IRP team will perform
	- Create an incident ticket, document initial findings, and assign an initial incident classification.
	- Determines the severity level of the incidents to determine the appropriate response. This is done by
		- Scope of impact – how many people, departments, or systems does it affect?
		- Criticality of the system or service – how important is it to the continuing operation of the institution?
		- Sensitivity of the information stored on or accessed through the system or service
		- Probability of propagation – how likely is it that the incident or negative impact will spread or propagate to other systems?
-  Five levels of incident severity are commonly used to guide incident response:
	- Priority 1 (Disaster)
		- Usually priority 1 incidents are escalated to the disaster recovery team
	- Priority 2 (Total loss of critical services)
	- Priority 3 (Interruption of critical systems & severe degradation)
	- Priority 4 (Interruption of non-critical systems)
	- Priority 5 (Localized incident with minimal impact)

### Containment phase
- In this phase, we contain and prevent any further impact.
- Some of the methods to contain incidents include the incident in order to limit the harm to systems
	- Disconnect affected systems from the network
	- Revoke access rights/permissions from unauthorized accounts
	- Disable compromised accounts
	- Reconfigure firewalls to temporarily block incoming malicious traffic
	- Temporarily disable a compromised service
	- When the above fails, shut down the system and network to minimise the impacts of the incident
- The activation of the above steps should be based on the IRP document
### Eradication phase
- In this phase, the root cause of the [[cybersecurity]] incident is determined and dealt with thoroughly.
- For example,
	- all the backdoors and malware installed by the attacker are securely removed,
	- all systems are hardened and patched or fixes applied are applied and tested thoroughly, and
	- updates such as the access passwords of all login accounts that may have been accessed by the attacker should be applied
	- Disable unnecessary services
### Recovery phase
- In this phase, the affected systems is restored to its normal operation
- Examples of tasks include:
	- If you have to re-install files or the operating system, do it from the trusted source.
	- The service should be restarted in stages starting with core service and in a controlled manner
	- Ensure that the files and systems restored are clean and verify that the system is back to its normal operation.
	- Notify stakeholders including operators, administrators, senior management about the resumption of the system
### Post-incident phase
- The IRP team holds an after-action meeting to discuss lessons learned from handling the incident.
	- Determine what worked well in the response plan and what did not.
	- Determine what weakness did the breach exploit and document to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future.
	- Determining what to do with the evidence collected (e.g. prosecution or appropriate disciplinary actions)
	- Produce after-action report that identify strengths to be maintained and built upon, as well as identifying potential areas of improvement
# [[Cybersecurity]] Disaster Recovery
- You set out the detailed steps needed to be followed before, during and after a disaster.
	- structured procedures, techniques and tools to be used
	- the resources, personnel and [[data]] that are required to recover IT infrastructures to the usual level of operations
	- the time frame within which critical IT services need to be reinstated
- During an emergency, this document will be the primary source of information for disaster recovery procedures.
- The plan to be continually updated to reflect any significant internal, external or systems changes in the organisation.
- DR plans vary from organisation to organisation based on the company’s size, location and industry
## Disaster Recovery Phases
- Activation Phase: appropriate operations staff are notified, and teams are mobilised and recovery operations start. The activation phase involves:
	- Notification procedures
	- Damage assessment
	- Disaster recovery activation planning
- Execution Phase: In this phase,
	- the actual procedures to recover each of the disaster affected [[entities]] are executed.
	- Business operations are restored on the recovery system.
- Reconstitution Phase: In this phase the original system is restored and execution phase procedures are stopped
### Activation Phase
Notification Procedures:
- The notification procedure defines the [[process]] to alert recovery personnel during and outside business hours.
- Notification can take place by e-mail, phone, etc.
- A general notification technique is a call tree. 
### Execution Phase
- The activities of this phase focus on bringing up the disaster recovery system.
- The recovery procedure reflects priorities previously analysed during the activation planning phase.
- To avoid confusion in an emergency situation, the recovery procedures should be documented in a simple step-by-step format, without assuming or omitting any procedural steps
### Reconstitution Phase
- The following major activities occur in this phase:
	- Continuously monitor the site or facility’s fitness for reoccupation
	- Verify that the site is free from aftereffects of the disaster and that there are no further threats
	- Ensure that all needed infrastructure services, such as power, water, telecommunications, [[security]], environmental controls, office equipment, and supplies, are operational
	- Install system hardware, software, and firmware
	- Establish connectivity between internal and external systems
	- Test system operations to ensure full functionality
	- Shut down the contingency system
	- Terminate contingency operations
	- Secure, remove, and relocate all sensitive materials at the contingency site
	- Arrange for operations staff to return to the original facility
