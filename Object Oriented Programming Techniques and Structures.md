ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
[[Object-oriented programming (OOP)]] techniques and structures facilitate the creation of modular, reusable, and [[maintainable code]] through [[encapsulation]], [[inheritance]], and [[polymorphism]].

MAIN POINTS:
1. [[Encapsulation]] hides the internal [[state]] of an [[object]], exposing only necessary parts through public methods.
2. [[Inheritance]] allows a [[class]] to inherit properties and methods from another [[class]], promoting [[code reuse]].
3. [[Polymorphism]] enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common [[superclass]].
4. Classes are blueprints for creating objects, defining their properties and behaviors.
5. Objects are instances of classes, encapsulating data and the methods that operate on that data.
6. [[Abstraction]] simplifies complexity by hiding the detailed [[implementation]] and showing only the necessary features of an [[object]] or method.
7. Interfaces define a contract for what a [[class]] can do, without specifying how it does it.
8. Composition over [[inheritance]] is a principle suggesting the use of [[object composition]] to achieve [[code reuse]] over [[class]] [[inheritance]].
9. [[Method overloading]] allows multiple methods in a [[class]] to have the same name but different parameters.
10. Design patterns provide solutions to common [[software design]] problems and can improve code [[readability]] and [[scalability]].

TAKEAWAYS:
1. OOP techniques improve [[software design]] and development by promoting [[modularity]], reusability, and [[flexibility]].
2. Understanding and applying [[encapsulation]], [[inheritance]], and [[polymorphism]] is fundamental to effective OOP.
3. [[Abstraction]] and interfaces [[help]] manage complexity and enforce consistency in [[software development]].
4. The principle of composition over [[inheritance]] encourages more flexible and [[maintainable code]] structures.
5. Leveraging design patterns can significantly enhance the quality and efficiency of software solutions.
