# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
[[Swift]]'s [[data]] types provide a robust framework for defining and manipulating various kinds of [[data]], ensuring [[type safety]] and performance.

# OVERVIEW:
[[Swift]], Apple's [[programming language]], offers a comprehensive set of [[data]] types that are designed to be safe, fast, and expressive. These [[data]] types include basic types like `Int`, `Double`, `Float`, `Bool`, and `String`, as well as more complex types like `Array`, `Dictionary`, and `Set`. [[Swift]]'s type system is strongly typed, meaning that each variable must be explicitly declared with a type, which helps prevent errors and ensures code reliability. [[Swift]] also supports type inference, allowing the [[compiler]] to deduce the type of a variable based on its initial value. Additionally, [[Swift]] introduces advanced [[data]] types such as `Optional`, which safely handles the absence of a value, and `Tuple`, which groups multiple values into a single compound value. These features make [[Swift]] a powerful language for developing applications with clear and [[maintainable code]].

# MAIN POINTS:
