Variables are storage for information
- a variable is a place to put data
- each variable must have at least a name, and a stored data value
	- most languages also require a type to be assigned to each variable
- [[Reference types]] start with uppercase letters
- [[Primitive types]] start with lowercase letters
	- this is because primative types are reserved words (you cannot create a variable with that name.)
- you cannot make more than 1 variable with the same name in the same scope
	- this applied to [[Java]] and [[Python]]
# Python vs Java
- [[Python]] is a strongly dynamically typed language
- [[Java]] is a very strongly statically typed language
	- what this means is that python variables can be anything you want, Java must have a predefined type
