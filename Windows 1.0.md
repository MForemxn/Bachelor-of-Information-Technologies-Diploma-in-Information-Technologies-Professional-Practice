Not to be confused with [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10 "Windows 10").

**Windows 1.0** is the first major release of [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows"), a family of [graphical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical user interface") [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") for [personal computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer") developed by [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft"). It was first [released to manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Released-to-manufacturing "Released-to-manufacturing") in the United States on November 20, 1985, while the European version was released as Windows 1.02 in May 1986.

Its development began after the Microsoft co-founder and spearhead of Windows 1.0, [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates "Bill Gates"), saw a demonstration of a similar software suite, [Visi On](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visi_On "Visi On"), at [COMDEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMDEX "COMDEX") in 1982. The [operating environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_environment "Operating environment") was showcased to the public in November 1983, although it ended up being released two years later. Windows 1.0 runs on [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS "MS-DOS"), as a [16-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16-bit "16-bit") [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing) "Shell (computing)") program known as [MS-DOS Executive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS_Executive "MS-DOS Executive"), and it provides an environment which can run graphical [programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") designed for Windows, as well as existing MS-DOS software. It introduced multitasking and the use of the [mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse "Computer mouse"), and various built-in programs such as [Calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Calculator "Microsoft Calculator"), [Paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint "Microsoft Paint"), and [Notepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad_(Windows) "Notepad (Windows)"). The operating environment does not allow its windows to overlap, and instead, the windows are [tiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager "Tiling window manager"). Windows 1.0 also contains four releases, which contain minor updates to the system.

The system received lukewarm reviews; critics raised concerns about not fulfilling expectations, its [compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_compatibility "Computer compatibility") with very little [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software "Software"), and its performance issues, while it has also received positive responses to Microsoft's early presentations and support from a number of hardware- and software-makers. Its last release was 1.04, and it was succeeded by [Windows 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2.0x "Windows 2.0x"), which was released in December 1987. Microsoft ended its support for Windows 1.0 on December 31, 2001, making it the longest-supported out of all versions of Windows.

## Development history

[Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") showed its desire to develop a [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical user interface") (GUI) as early as 1981.[1] The development of Windows began after [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates "Bill Gates"), co-founder of Microsoft and the lead developer of Windows, saw a demonstration at [COMDEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMDEX "COMDEX")1982 of [VisiCorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCorp "VisiCorp")'s [Visi On](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visi_On "Visi On"), a GUI software suite for [IBM PC compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible "IBM PC compatible")computers.[2] A year later, Microsoft learned that [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc.")'s own GUI software—also bit-mapped, and based in part on research from [Xerox PARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_PARC "Xerox PARC")—was much more advanced; Microsoft decided they needed to differentiate their own offering.[1] In August 1983, Gates recruited [Scott A. McGregor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_A._McGregor "Scott A. McGregor"), one of the key developers behind PARC's original windowing system, to be the developer team lead for Windows 1.0.[3][4][5]

Microsoft first demonstrated a window manager to the press in September 1983. The demonstration featured a user interface similar to [Multiplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplan "Multiplan") and other contemporary Microsoft applications with a command bar in the bottom of the screen. It also showed multiple application windows in both [overlapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacking_window_manager "Stacking window manager") and [tiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager "Tiling window manager")arrangements.[6] This user interface concept was soon reworked to only support tiled windows and to change the Multiplan-like command bar into a menu bar under each window's title bar. The redesigned environment ultimately had its public debut at Fall COMDEX 1983 in November 1983.[7] Initially requiring 192 [KB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilobyte "Kilobyte")of RAM and two [floppy disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk "Floppy disk") drives, Microsoft described the software as a [device driver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver "Device driver") for [MS-DOS 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS "MS-DOS"). By supporting [cooperative multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking "Cooperative multitasking") in [tiled windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager "Tiling window manager")when using well-behaved applications that only used DOS [system calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call "System call") and permitting non-well-behaved applications to run in a full screen, Windows differed from both Visi On and Apple Computer's [Lisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lisa "Apple Lisa") by immediately offering many applications. Unlike Visi On, Windows developers did not need to use [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix "Unix")to develop IBM PC applications; Microsoft planned to encourage other companies, including competitors, to develop programs for Windows by not requiring a Microsoft [user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface "User interface") in their applications.[6]

Manufacturers of MS-DOS computers such as [Compaq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq "Compaq"), [Zenith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith_Data_Systems "Zenith Data Systems"), and [DEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation "Digital Equipment Corporation")promised to provide support, as did software companies such as [Ashton-Tate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashton-Tate "Ashton-Tate")and [Lotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Software "Lotus Software").[7] After previewing Windows, _[BYTE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYTE "BYTE")_ magazine stated in December 1983 that it "seems to offer remarkable openness, reconfigurability, and transportability as well as modest hardware requirements and pricing … Barring a surprise product introduction from another company, Microsoft Windows will be the first large-scale test of the [desktop metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_metaphor "Desktop metaphor") in the hands of its intended users."[8] From early in Windows's history, Gates viewed it as Microsoft's future. He told _InfoWorld_ magazine in April 1984 that "our strategies and energies as a company are totally committed to Windows, in the same way that we're committed to operating-system [kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system) "Kernel (operating system)") like MS-DOS and [Xenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenix "Xenix"). We're also saying that only applications that take advantage of Windows will be competitive in the long run."[9] [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM") was notably absent from Microsoft's announcement,[7]and the corporation rejected Windows in favor of creating its own product called [TopView](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_TopView "IBM TopView").[10] By late 1984, the press reported a "War of the Windows" between Windows, IBM's TopView, and [Digital Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Research "Digital Research")'s [Graphics Environment Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Environment_Manager "Graphics Environment Manager")(GEM).[11] [Steve Ballmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer "Steve Ballmer") replaced McGregor after he left the team in January 1985.[10]

Microsoft had promised in November 1983 to ship Windows by April 1984,[7]although, due to various design modifications, its release date was delayed.[12]During its development and before its windowing system was developed, it was briefly referred to by the codename "Interface Manager".[13][14] De-emphasizing multitasking, the company stated that Windows' purpose, unlike that of TopView, was to "turn the computer into a [graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics "Graphics")-rich environment" while using less memory.[11] After Microsoft persuaded IBM that the latter needed a GUI,[1] the two companies announced in April 1987 the introduction of [OS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2 "OS/2") and its graphical OS/2 [Presentation Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_Manager "Presentation Manager"), which were supposed to ultimately replace both MS-DOS and Windows.[15]

### Release versions

The first retail release, Windows 1.01, was released on November 20, 1985, to the United States, at the cost of $99 (~$269.00 in 2022).[16][17] The following release, 1.02, was published in May 1986 mainly for the European market, and it had also introduced non-English versions of Windows 1.0.[12][18] Windows version 1.03, released in August 1986, included enhancements that made it consistent with the international release like [drivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver "Device driver") for non-U.S. keyboards and additional screen and printer drivers, and superseded both version 1.01 in the US and version 1.02 in Europe.[19][20] Windows version 1.04, released in April 1987, added support for the new [IBM PS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PS/2 "IBM PS/2") computers, although no support for PS/2 mice or new [VGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA "VGA") graphics modes was provided.[21] However, on May 27, 1987, an OEM version was released by IBM, which added VGA support, PS/2 mouse support, MCGA support, and support for the [8514](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8514 "8514")/A display driver.[22] IBM released this version on three 3.5-inch 720k floppies and offered it as part of their "Personal Publishing System" and "Collegiate Kit" bundles.[23] Microsoft ended its support for Windows 1.0 on December 31, 2001, making it the longest-supported one out of all versions of Windows.[24][25]

## Features

Windows 1.0 was built on the MS-DOS [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system) "Kernel (operating system)"),[26][27] while it runs as a [16-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16-bit "16-bit")[shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system_shell "Operating system shell") program known as the [MS-DOS Executive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS_Executive "MS-DOS Executive"),[28] and it offers limited multitasking of existing MS-DOS programs and concentrates on creating an interaction [paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm "Paradigm") (cf. [message loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_loop_in_Microsoft_Windows "Message loop in Microsoft Windows")), an execution model and a stable [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface "Application programming interface") for [native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_mode "Native mode") programs for the future.[14][16][29][30] The [operating environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_environment "Operating environment") supports the use of a [mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse "Computer mouse"), which allows users to perform click-and-drag operations.[16][31] Contrary to modern Windows operating systems, the mouse button had to be kept pressed to display the selected menu.[12]

Opening [.exe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXE "EXE") files in the [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS "MS-DOS") Executive would open an application window.[16] Windows 1.0 also includes programs such as the [Calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Calculator "Microsoft Calculator"), [Paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint "Microsoft Paint") (then known as Paintbrush), [Notepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad_(Windows) "Notepad (Windows)"), [Write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Write "Microsoft Write"), [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator "Terminal emulator"), and Clock.[17][32] Paint only supports [monochrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochrome "Monochrome") graphics.[16] The operating environment also has the [Cardfile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardfile "Cardfile") manager, a Clipboard, and a Print Spooler program.[33] Initially, _Puzzle_and _Chess_ were supposed to appear as playable [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game "Video game"), although Microsoft scrapped the idea; instead, it introduced _Reversi_ as a commercially published video game. It was included in Windows 1.0 as a built-in application, and it relies on mouse control.[16][34] The operating environment also introduced the [Control Panel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_Panel_(Windows) "Control Panel (Windows)"), which was used to configure the features of Windows 1.0. The operating environment does not allow [overlapping windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacking_window_manager "Stacking window manager"), and instead, the windows are tiled.[14][16] When a program gets minimized, its icon would appear on a horizontal line at the bottom of the screen, which resembles the [modern-day Windows taskbar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskbar#Microsoft_Windows "Taskbar").[12]

It also consists of three [dynamic-link libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library "Dynamic-link library"), which are located as files in the system under the names KERNEL.EXE, USER.EXE, and GDI.EXE.[35] The [Windows 1.0 SDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_SDK "Microsoft Windows SDK") contains debugging versions of these files, which can be used to replace the corresponding files on the setup disks.[36]: 13, 200  The setup program combines multiple system files into one, so that Windows boots faster. Using the debugging KERNEL.EXE provided by the Windows 1.0 SDK one can create a "slow boot" version of Windows, where the files are separate.[37]Windows 1.0 includes a kernel, which performs functions such as task handling, [memory management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management "Memory management"), and input and output of files, while the two other dynamic-link libraries are the [user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface "User interface") and [Graphics Device Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Device_Interface "Graphics Device Interface").[38][39] The operating environment could also move the program code and data segments in memory, to allow programs to share code and data that are located in dynamic-link libraries.[40] Windows 1.0 implemented the use of code segment swapping.[41]

Version 1.02 introduced drivers for European keyboards, as well as screen and print drivers. The last Windows 1.0 release, 1.04, introduced support for IBM PS/2 computers.[42] Due to Microsoft's extensive support for [backward compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility "Backward compatibility"), it is not only possible to execute Windows 1.0 [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable "Executable") programs on current versions of Windows to a large extent but also to recompile their [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code")into an equally functional "modern" application with just limited modifications.[43]

In March 2022, it was discovered that the operating environment also includes an [easter egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media) "Easter egg (media)") that lists the developers who worked on the operating environment along with a message that says "Congrats!".[44][45]

## System requirements

The official system requirements for Windows 1.0 include the following.

|   |   |   |   |   |

|Mouse|A Microsoft-compatible pointing device is recommended, but not required|   |   |   |

Besides the minimum system requirements, Microsoft has also published a note in which it recommended additional memory when using multiple applications or DOS 3.3.[50]

## Reception

Windows 1.0 was released to lukewarm and mixed reviews.[16][51] Critics considered the platform to have future potential but felt that Windows 1.0 had not fulfilled expectations and that it could not compete with Apple's GUI operating system.[31] It was also criticized for its slowness and compatibility with very little software.[52] Reviews criticized its demanding system requirements, especially noting the poor performance experienced when running multiple applications at once, and that Windows encouraged the use of a mouse for navigation, a relatively new concept at the time.[2] _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")_compared the performance of Windows on a system with 512 KB of RAM to "pouring [molasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molasses "Molasses") in the Arctic" and that its design was inflexible for keyboard users due to its dependency on a mouse-oriented interface. In conclusion, the _Times_ felt that the poor performance, lack of dedicated software, uncertain compatibility with DOS programs, and the lack of tutorials for new users made DOS-based software such as [Borland Sidekick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Sidekick "Borland Sidekick") (which could provide a similar assortment of accessories and multitasking functionality) more desirable for most PC users.[50]

According to the _[Computerworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerworld "Computerworld")_ magazine, Windows 1.0 received 500,000 sales from its release in 1985 up to April 1987.[53][54] In retrospect, Windows 1.0 was regarded as a flop by contemporary technology publications, who, however, still acknowledged its overall importance to the history of the [Windows line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows").[2][55][56][Nathaniel Borenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Borenstein "Nathaniel Borenstein") (who went on to develop the [MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME "MIME") standards) and his IT team at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University "Carnegie Mellon University") were also critical of Windows when it was first presented to them by a group of Microsoft representatives. Underestimating the future impact of the platform, he believed that in comparison to an in-house window manager, "these guys came in with this pathetic and naïve system. We just knew they were never going to accomplish anything."[57] _[The Verge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge "The Verge")_considered the poor reception towards the release of [Windows 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8 "Windows 8") in 2012 as a parallel to Microsoft's struggles with early versions of Windows. In a similar fashion to Windows 1.0 running atop MS-DOS as a layer, Windows 8 offered a new type of interface and software geared towards an emerging form of [human interface device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_device "Human interface device") on PCs, in this case, a [touchscreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen "Touchscreen"), running atop the [legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system "Legacy system")[Windows shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_shell "Windows shell") used by previous versions.[2]

A mock version of Windows 1.0 was created by Microsoft as an app for [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10 "Windows 10") as part of a tie-in with the [Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix "Netflix") show, _[Stranger Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things "Stranger Things")_, aligned with the release of the show's [third season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_3) "Stranger Things (season 3)"), which takes place during 1985.[58]
