# What is Windows 1.0?
- Windows 1.0 was the very first version of the Microsoft Windows line of [[operating systems]].
- officially released on November 20, 1985, by Microsoft Corporation.
- designed to be a graphical [[user interface]] ([[GUI]]) for the [[MS-DOS]] operating system, which was command-line based.
- it allowed users to point and click to access programs and manage files, rather than typing commands.

# Features of Windows 1.0
- introduced basic features that would become staples of the Windows operating system, such as:
	- windows that could be moved, resized, and overlapped
	- a simple menu-driven interface
	- basic applications like Calculator, Calendar, Cardfile, Clipboard viewer, Clock, Notepad, Paint, Reversi, Terminal, and Write.
- it was not a complete operating system on its own but rather ran as a graphical shell on top of [[MS-DOS]].

# Reception and Impact
- Windows 1.0 was met with mixed reviews upon its release.
	- some critics viewed it as a promising start for graphical interfaces on PC platforms.
	- others found it to be slow, limited in functionality, and not particularly user-friendly.
- despite its lukewarm reception, Windows 1.0 laid the groundwork for the development of future versions of Windows.
	- it introduced the concept of multitasking in a graphical environment on PCs.

# Technical Specifications
- required [[MS-DOS]] 2.0 to run.
- the system requirements were considered high at the time:
	- 256 KB of RAM
	- two double-sided floppy disk drives or a hard disk
	- a graphics adapter card.
- it supported tiled windows but did not allow for overlapping windows, a feature that would be introduced in later versions.

# Legacy
- Windows 1.0 is often remembered more for its historical significance than for its technical prowess.
- it marked the beginning of the Windows operating system, which would go on to become one of the most widely used [[operating systems]] in the world.
- the evolution from Windows 1.0 to the sophisticated, feature-rich versions of Windows available today showcases the rapid advancement in computer technology and [[user interface]] design over the past few decades.
