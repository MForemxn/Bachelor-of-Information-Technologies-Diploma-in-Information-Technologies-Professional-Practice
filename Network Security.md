# Segmentation and Defence in Depth Strategies
## Defence in Depth
- layered defence strategies to protect against a variety of threats
## Segmentation
- Network Segmentation: dividing a network into smaller parts helps isolate and contain potential breaches, reducing the overall impact
- Role of Firewalls and Access Controls: Use firewalls and [[access control lists]] to regulate traffic between segments based on a [[security]] policy
## Recovery Strategies:
- Preparation: Preparing for incidents by having a plan in place
- Detection and response: the ability to detect breaches and respond effectively to mitigate damage
- Recovery and Restoration: Recovering from an attack and restoring systems to their normal [[state]] to maintain business continuity
# IP Spoofing
- allows an attacker to change the network packets to they appear to have originated somewhere else.
