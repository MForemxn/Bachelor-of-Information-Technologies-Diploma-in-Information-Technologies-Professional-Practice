## OVERVIEW:
Business rules (BR) are formal statements that describe the operations, definitions, and constraints that apply to an organisation. They are essential for ensuring that business processes are consistent, efficient, and aligned with the organisation's goals. Business rules can cover a wide range of areas, including data integrity, workflow processes, compliance requirements, and decision-making criteria. They help in automating processes, reducing errors, and ensuring that all stakeholders follow the same guidelines. Business rules are often implemented in business rule management systems (BRMS) or embedded within software applications to enforce consistency and compliance. They can be categorised into different types, such as structural rules, which define relationships between data elements, and procedural rules, which dictate the sequence of operations. Effective business rule management involves regular review and updates to adapt to changing business environments and regulatory requirements.
