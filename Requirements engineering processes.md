## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Requirements engineering [[processes]] involve the systematic [[identification]], documentation, and management of system requirements to ensure successful project outcomes.

## OVERVIEW:
Requirements engineering is a critical phase in the system development lifecycle that focuses on understanding and documenting what a system should do. This [[Process]] involves several key activities: [[Requirements Elicitation]], analysis, [[Requirements Specification]], validation, and management. [[Requirements Elicitation]] is the [[Process]] of gathering requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and observation. Analysis involves refining and prioritising these requirements to ensure they are clear and feasible. [[Requirements Specification]] is the documentation of the requirements in a detailed and structured format. Validation ensures that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are achievable within the project constraints. Finally, requirements management involves tracking and updating requirements as the project evolves. Effective requirements engineering helps prevent scope creep, reduces the risk of project failure, and ensures that the final system meets user needs and expectations.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Requirements engineering is crucial in the system development lifecycle.
2. [[Requirements Elicitation]] gathers requirements from stakeholders.
3. Analysis refines and prioritises requirements.
4. [[Requirements Specification]] documents requirements in detail.
5. Validation ensures requirements reflect stakeholder needs.
6. Management tracks and updates requirements.
7. Prevents scope creep and project failure.
8. Ensures the final system meets user needs.
9. Involves various techniques like interviews and surveys.
10. Requires continuous stakeholder engagement.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Requirements engineering ensures clear and feasible system requirements.
2. Effective [[Requirements Elicitation]] and analysis are vital for project success.
3. Detailed [[Requirements Specification]] and validation prevent misunderstandings.
4. Continuous management adapts requirements to project changes.
5. Stakeholder engagement is essential throughout the [[Process]].
