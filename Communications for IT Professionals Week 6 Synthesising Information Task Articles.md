# Article 1
The power of technology is reshaping industries and revolutionizing the ways we live and work. However, along with the added productivity, convenience and power that technology brings comes a significant responsibility for industries, governments and citizens to ensure its ethical use.

While there’s justifiable excitement about the many new technologies entering the market—especially, although not limited to, artificial intelligence—it’s important to ensure they’re used wisely and well and for the benefit of all members of society. Below, 16 members of [Forbes Technology Council](http://councils.forbes.com/forbestechcouncil "http://councils.forbes.com/forbestechcouncil") share some of the current and potential ethical challenges concerning technology as well as how all of us as a society can address them.

## 1. Protecting Private Information

With an exponential increase in the collection and storage of personal data, challenges have arisen regarding privacy. As we traverse the technological frontier, an increasingly pressing issue that troubles me greatly is the difficulty of preserving the [[confidentiality]] of private information, owing to our growing dependence on digital infrastructures across almost all daily activities. Privacy is a privilege nowadays. - [Mark Ruber](https://councils.forbes.com/u/9b172c3d-e36c-4115-b70a-38c71fc1f2c9 "https://councils.forbes.com/u/9b172c3d-e36c-4115-b70a-38c71fc1f2c9"), [MTSolutions Group](https://www.mtsolutionsgroup.com/ "https://www.mtsolutionsgroup.com/")

## 2. The Rush To Deploy [[AI]]

With the advances in generative [[AI]], companies cannot avoid the rush to capitalize on the acceleration of knowledge worker tasks. However, rushing to deploy [[AI]] creates minefields of new risks, including unintended biases and regulatory violations. The [mass layoffs](https://www.ft.com/content/26372287-6fb3-457b-9e9c-f722027f36b3 "https://www.ft.com/content/26372287-6fb3-457b-9e9c-f722027f36b3") of in-house ethics teams at several large tech companies should serve as motivation for others to double down on their pursuit of responsible [[AI]]. - [Usama Fayyad](https://councils.forbes.com/u/f76ed1fd-a6e6-4abc-8fe2-5e44d21ec653 "https://councils.forbes.com/u/f76ed1fd-a6e6-4abc-8fe2-5e44d21ec653"), [Institute for Experiential [[AI]], Northeastern University](https://ai.northeastern.edu/ "https://ai.northeastern.edu/")

## 3. The Proliferation Of Misinformation

One ethical crisis in technology is its ability to easily create “deep fakes” and misinformation. Technology makes it possible for the video you are watching to look accurate, even though it’s not. Or, the article you are reading may seem to be correct but is really riddled with misinformation. Now more than ever, relying on trusted sources that provide vigorously validated content is critical. - [Michael Dennis](https://councils.forbes.com/u/61a19bc8-ae0e-4dd1-862e-dc8c44e2d249 "https://councils.forbes.com/u/61a19bc8-ae0e-4dd1-862e-dc8c44e2d249"), [CAS, a division of the American Chemical Society](https://www.cas.org/ "https://www.cas.org/")

## 4. The Need For [[AI]] Guardrails

[[AI]] tools can be a great benefit to companies in terms of productivity and efficiency, but it’s critical that they’re supervised. Tech leaders must get ahead of ethical concerns related to [[data protection]], [[security]] and intellectual property by introducing industrywide regulations, as well as company-level guardrails that will ensure that artificial intelligence is both safe and effective. - [Marco Santos](https://councils.forbes.com/u/eaa8cf6a-6839-4b45-9ced-dfebcf268216 "https://councils.forbes.com/u/eaa8cf6a-6839-4b45-9ced-dfebcf268216"), [GFT](https://www.gft.com/ "https://www.gft.com/")

## 5. The Lack Of Transparency Around Data Usage

We know that our data is being used by businesses, and we are happy when our data is used to improve service quality. However, a potential issue that is burgeoning today is the lack of transparency around companies’ usage of personal data. Consumers need answers to the following questions. How are businesses using my data? Are they sharing it with other providers to deliver a better service? What data is being used and where? The transparency crisis is looming. - [Kiran Menon](https://councils.forbes.com/u/cd9813c5-6546-4dcf-b33d-34a96517647a "https://councils.forbes.com/u/cd9813c5-6546-4dcf-b33d-34a96517647a"), [Tydy](https://www.tydy.co/ "https://www.tydy.co/")

## 6. Ensuring [[AI]] Is Used Only For Good

Generative [[AI]] and large language models in particular are advancing rapidly and are becoming more and more powerful by the day. How do we ensure [[AI]] is used for good? How do we provide the necessary guardrails, privacy and [[security]]? And how do we minimize deception and, more importantly, provide transparency about generative [[AI]]? The first one concerns me the most—let’s hope regulations can come fast enough. - [Lana Feng](https://councils.forbes.com/u/b1917a5a-08cf-4591-8def-20ca1a7af4cc "https://councils.forbes.com/u/b1917a5a-08cf-4591-8def-20ca1a7af4cc"), [Huma.[[AI]], Inc.](http://huma.ai/ "http://huma.ai/")

## 7. Spyware

Government spyware and zero-day exploit markets present an ethical crisis. Software that’s designed to hide on your computer and steal information without your knowledge is malware, even if a “legitimate” company has sold it to a government organization. And not disclosing a zero-day vulnerability in a widely available consumer product, so the government can use it for espionage, puts us all at risk. Companies must do better. - [Corey Nachreiner](https://councils.forbes.com/u/f3e57da2-a65b-4745-9ce8-af5267628d8f "https://councils.forbes.com/u/f3e57da2-a65b-4745-9ce8-af5267628d8f"), [WatchGuard Technologies Inc.](https://www.watchguard.com/ "https://www.watchguard.com/")

## 8. The Ease Of Access To [[AI]]

The impact artificial intelligence will have on society is similar to or greater than that of the discovery of nuclear energy, so robust ethical guidelines need to be put in place. And it’s much easier to access [[AI]] than nuclear energy, which makes [[AI]] more difficult to control. A lot of thought must go into developing ways to detect [[AI]]’s harms and correct them. We don’t currently have many effective measures for this. - [Kazuhiro Gomi](https://councils.forbes.com/u/b09cfb6c-c6cd-48a3-a31e-fd4d9040b3e4 "https://councils.forbes.com/u/b09cfb6c-c6cd-48a3-a31e-fd4d9040b3e4"), [NTT Research](https://ntt-research.com/ "https://ntt-research.com/")

## 9. Fabricated Studies Being Quoted By Generative [[AI]]

Generative [[AI]] is generating articles that quote studies by real organizations, but those studies are fabricated. So now we are being served statistics that are completely fabricated, yet attributed to analyst groups or the Big 5 consultants. The amount of disinformation being spread is alarming. We all need to be fact-checking when we use generative AI to help us create content. - [Laureen Knudsen](https://councils.forbes.com/u/8e7e9b5a-e3bc-4543-a5f4-c9fa2a2964c1 "https://councils.forbes.com/u/8e7e9b5a-e3bc-4543-a5f4-c9fa2a2964c1"), [Broadcom](https://www.broadcom.com/ "https://www.broadcom.com/")

## 10. The Lack Of Awareness About LLMs

Some entities are hiding or obscuring the fact that generative technology relies on large language models and are passing off the output as fact or truth. It is already hard to tell fact from fiction in 2023, but I suspect it is about to get a lot worse. - [Elise Carmichael](https://councils.forbes.com/u/ea5ce205-0fee-48f7-aa6f-b4a743464f3b "https://councils.forbes.com/u/ea5ce205-0fee-48f7-aa6f-b4a743464f3b"), [Lakeside Software](https://www.lakesidesoftware.com/ "https://www.lakesidesoftware.com/")

## 11. Blockchain’s Vulnerability To Scams

I’ve seen no industry that’s more scam-prone than blockchain. Quick coin launches fuel both innovation and abuse, and major scams have occurred even in regulated exchanges such as FTX. Regulation isn’t the answer; cryptographic solutions like zero-knowledge proof are. They can prove a smart contract’s function, validate an exchange’s claimed reserves and assure the accuracy of on-chain data. - [Marlene Ronstedt](https://councils.forbes.com/u/22034784-47d5-4ad0-937a-812b8eb0173c "https://councils.forbes.com/u/22034784-47d5-4ad0-937a-812b8eb0173c"), [Play by Ear](https://playbyear.xyz/ "https://playbyear.xyz/")

## 12. The Risk Of Biased Outcomes From [[AI]]

[[AI]]—especially the accelerated adoption of generative [[AI]]—comes with the ongoing risk of producing biased outcomes. [[AI]] models are trained on input data that reflects our societal biases, which can be amplified through machine learning. To develop responsible [[AI]] technologies, we have to understand what those biases are and make sure we can account for them accordingly. - [Merav Yuravlivker](https://councils.forbes.com/u/7f5d2edb-ddec-4e6a-9eb3-455a5198cead "https://councils.forbes.com/u/7f5d2edb-ddec-4e6a-9eb3-455a5198cead"), [Data Society](https://datasociety.com/ "https://datasociety.com/")

## 13. The Lack Of Consensus Over Appropriate Uses For Generative [[AI]]

Questions about ChatGPT’s ethical use are all over the news, as we’re not ready for it from an ethics standpoint. Is it okay to use ChatGPT to provide views for this discussion or to diagnose patients? We have no strategy for approaching [[AI]]. I hope big tech and government will come up with a code of ethics on how we can best use [[AI]] in our lives. It’ll take time, and now, it’s a question of personal ethics. - [Nadya Knysh](https://councils.forbes.com/u/13c5c129-d071-4bd3-9d61-a44fb7d2489a "https://councils.forbes.com/u/13c5c129-d071-4bd3-9d61-a44fb7d2489a"), [a1qa](https://www.a1qa.com/ "https://www.a1qa.com/")

## 14. The Alienation Of Older Consumers

As technology advances, companies need to ensure they aren’t leaving less tech-savvy users behind. Shuttering brick-and-mortar locations for ones located in the metaverse may make good financial sense and appeal to younger demographics, but it could alienate older customers. - [Patti Mikula](https://councils.forbes.com/u/d5dc30c0-1308-48d1-a72c-5fb98b7bad8e "https://councils.forbes.com/u/d5dc30c0-1308-48d1-a72c-5fb98b7bad8e"), [Hackworks Inc.](https://hackworks.com/ "https://hackworks.com/")

## 15. Falsified ‘Green Reports’

Technology enthusiasts enjoy the [[cybersecurity]] conversation, but when environmental concerns are the question, [[cybersecurity]] fails. Sometimes, individuals will produce “green reports” in which the metrics and information are falsified to satisfy management. This can be as simple as removing printers to meet benchmarks—which still means the environment is at risk. This is unethical. Encouraging responsible ownership is key. - [Dewayne Hart](https://councils.forbes.com/u/94008863-848d-4ef8-bd96-5b7f7e6b1aa9 "https://councils.forbes.com/u/94008863-848d-4ef8-bd96-5b7f7e6b1aa9"), [SEMAIS](https://semais.net/ "https://semais.net/")

## 16. The Risk Of Autonomous, Unchecked [[AI]] Systems

If [[AI]] systems become too autonomous and operate without proper safeguards, they could make decisions that are harmful or contrary to human values, leading to unintended and uncontrollable consequences. Governments should work alongside businesses, researchers and experts to develop comprehensive governance frameworks for [[AI]]. - [Fidelis Chibueze](https://councils.forbes.com/u/a1352be0-bf90-4415-a95e-5c8fe6bfd1b2 "https://councils.forbes.com/u/a1352be0-bf90-4415-a95e-5c8fe6bfd1b2"), [Fixtops Technology](http://fixtops.com/ "http://fixtops.com/")

# Article 2
People have been talking about [[AI]] ethics for over 70 years.

Isaac Asimov first introduced the famous three laws of robotics in his 1942 short story, “Runaround”. Back then, [[AI]] ethics were science fiction. Today, it’s a very real concern for every [[AI]] researcher. According to the Capgemini Research Institute, [[AI]] creates ethical issues in at least [9 out of 10 businesses](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2020/10/artificial-intelligence-ai-ethics-14-statistics).

But what are [[AI]] ethics?

In this blog post, we’ll take you through the key principles of AI ethics, explaining what each principle means, why it’s important, and how [high-quality data](https://www.prolific.co/ai-researchers) is pivotal to ethical [[AI]].

### What are [[AI]] ethics?

As [[AI]] technology becomes more advanced, ethical issues are more likely to arise. Artificial intelligence simulates human intelligence and [[decision]]-making. Unfortunately, this comes with many risks, including those to human safety.

[[AI]] needs a lot of data to work. If that data is inaccurate or biased, it can lead to poor-quality or even dangerous output.

[[AI]] ethics are a set of principles and guidelines for how we develop and use [[AI]]. Organizations incorporate these formally into [[AI]] ethics policies. This ensures that decisions made by staff and stakeholders are kept within ethical [[AI]] guidelines, minimize risks, and focus on improving life for all human beings.

### 5 key principles of [[AI]] ethics

#### 1. Transparency

From hiring [[processes]] to driverless cars, [[AI]] is integral to human safety and wellbeing. That's why [[AI]] systems [need to be transparent](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/nl/Documents/innovatie/deloitte-nl-innovation-bringing-transparency-and-ethics-into-ai.pdf). Businesses, customers, and the wider public need to understand how the algorithms work and why [[AI]] has made certain decisions.

For example, a bank might refuse a customer an online loan. The customer will naturally want to understand why the algorithm refused their application. With this information, they can potentially improve their chances of approval in the future.

preparing to introduce a register that will require public services across The Netherlands to publish their [[AI]] algorithms online. However, some have argued that this is the wrong way to improve transparency. Why? Most people won’t be able to understand the data. For an [[AI]] system to be transparent, developers need to be clear about how their [[AI]] makes its decisions. Meanwhile, public understanding of artificial intelligence also needs to be improved.

#### 2. Impartiality

Another key principle for [[AI]] ethics is impartiality. [[AI]] should treat all human beings equally. That means eliminating bias and discrimination from [[AI]] systems. How can you achieve this? With [high-quality data](https://www.prolific.co/blog/complete-guide-improving-data-quality-online-surveys). Many data sets are not specifically created for training [[AI]]. When they’re used for this purpose, they can pass on quirks and biases from the data collection process.  

Artificial intelligence can’t pick up on biases within its data. If this isn’t addressed, [[AI]] systems could repeat these biases and implement them automatically. There have been many cases of [AI bias upholding systemic forms of discrimination](https://www.prolific.co/blog/shocking-ai-bias) towards marginalized groups. That’s why researchers must use unbiased, high-quality data and test models to see if they display biased behavior.

#### 3. [[Accountability]]

[[Accountability]] is another important aspect of [[AI]] ethics. Algorithms are run by artificial intelligence. So, who is held accountable when something goes wrong? People and organizations who have worked on an [[AI]] system need to be held accountable at each stage of the process, not just after the [[AI]] is already operating.

With [[AI]] [[accountability]], prevention is as important as the cure. Teams need to ensure they understand how well the system is working, supervise the development of the algorithms, and select high-quality data to feed into the system. Organizations should consult diversity experts, as well as people who will be using the [[AI]] system. What’s more, if an [[AI]] system is used for sensitive purposes, such as public services, it should always be held accountable by external review.

#### 4. Reliability

[[AI]] systems need to be reliable. This ensures that the results achieved by the system are reproducible and consistent. That’s especially important when [[AI]] is being used for an important service, such as healthcare or credit applications.

Monitoring [[AI]] systems is key to ensuring their reliability. This way, any issues are immediately reported, and measures can be put in place to mitigate risks.

#### 5. [[Security]] and privacy

[[Security]] measures need to be established to ensure that sensitive data is stored and used securely. These measures include data [[encryption]], locating system vulnerabilities and defending against malicious attacks. Responsible data collection and robust data governance practices are also essential.

[According to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/01/27/ai-ethics-really-come-down-to-security/?sh=6a4c62be1676), one of the biggest challenges is that [[AI]] is often patched together by a network of very different creators. This makes it hard to achieve the levels of [[accountability]], reliability, and [[security]] needed for ethical [[AI]]. To become truly secure, you need a unified approach to [[security]] across the entire lifespan of the [[AI]] system.

### Ethical [[AI]] hinges on high-quality data

So, what are [[AI]] ethics in practice? Ultimately, it’s all about data! That includes everything from the way you use it to the quality of the data you collect. Poor-quality, biased data leads to poor outcomes. As we’ve shown, [AI bias](https://www.prolific.co/blog/shocking-ai-bias) has a hugely detrimental impact on businesses, researchers, and the wider population.

# Article 3
Ethics certainly creates a buzz in the business world. Ethical issues such as how we treat others, use information, engage with employees, manage resources, approach sustainability, and impact the world around us all affect how we view companies. In fact, the inappropriate treatment of people and the communities we live in are often the subject of scrutiny and can signal the difference between business success or failure. That’s why businesses (even tech giants such as [Microsoft](https://venturebeat.com/2020/05/06/how-microsoft-openai-and-oecd-are-putting-ai-ethics-principles-into-practice/)) often strive for ethical [[decision]] making and practices.

## Most Important Ethical Issues in Technology

Businesses today are faced with several ethical challenges. Critical decisions have to be made to ensure we are protecting personal freedoms and using data appropriately. Which ethical issues are the most important in 2024? Here are the top five.

### Misuse of Personal Information

One of the primary ethical dilemmas in our technologically empowered age revolves around how businesses use personal information. As we browse internet sites, make online purchases, enter our information on websites, engage with different businesses online and participate in social media, we are constantly providing personal details. Companies often gather information to hyper-personalize our online experiences, but to what extent is that information actually impeding our right to privacy?

Personal information is the new gold, as the saying goes. We have commoditized data because of the value it provides to businesses attempting to reach their consumer base. But when does it go too far? For businesses, it’s extremely valuable to know what kind of products are being searched for and what type of content people are consuming the most. For political figures, it’s important to know what kind of social or legal issues are getting the most attention. These valuable data points are often exploited so that businesses or entities can make money or advance their goals. Facebook in particular has come under fire several times over the years for selling personal data it gathers on its platform.

### Misinformation and Deep Fakes

One thing that became evident during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections was the potential of misinformation to gain a wider support base. The effect created polarization that has had wide-reaching effects on global economic and political environments.

In contrast to how information was accessed prior to the internet, we are constantly flooded with real-time events and news as it breaks. Celebrities and political figures can disseminate opinions on social media without fact checking, which is then aggregated and further spread despite its accuracy—or inaccuracy. Information no longer undergoes the strenuous validation process that we formerly used to publish newspapers and books.

Similarly, we used to believe that video told a story that was undeniably rooted in truth. But deepfake technology now allows such a sophisticated manipulation of digital imagery that people appear to be saying and doing things that never happened. The potential for privacy invasion and misuse of identity is very high with the use of this technology.

### Lack of Oversight and Acceptance of Responsibility

Most companies operate with a hybrid stack, comprised of a blend of third-party and owned technology. As a result, there is often some confusion about where responsibility lies when it comes to governance, use of [[big data]], [[cybersecurity]] concerns and managing personally identifiable information or PII. Whose responsibility is it _really_ to ensure data is protected? If you engage a third party for software that [[processes]] payments, do you bear any responsibility if credit card details are breached? The fact is that it’s everyone’s job. Businesses need to adopt a perspective where all collective parties share responsibility.

Similarly, many experts lobby for a global approach to governance, arguing that local policing is resulting in fractured policy making and a widespread mismanagement of data. Similar to climate change, we need to band together if we truly want to see improvement.

### Use of [[AI]]

Artificial intelligence certainly offers great business potential. But, at what point do [[AI]] systems cross an ethical line into dangerous territory?

- **Facial recognition:** Use of software to find individuals can quickly become a less-than-ethical problem. [According to the NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/technology/facial-recognition-software.html), there are various concerns about facial recognition, such as misuse, racial bias and restriction of personal freedoms. The ability to track movements and activity quickly morphs into a lack of privacy. [Facial recognition also isn’t foolproof](https://www.axios.com/facial-recognition-tech-new-jersey-false-arrest-7c1237e3-88de-43cf-961f-14e562a4dc3b.html) and can create bias in certain situations.

- **Replacement of jobs:** While this is anticipated to a certain degree, [[AI]] is meant to increase automation of low-level tasks in many situations so that human resources can be used on more strategic initiatives and complicated job duties. The large-scale elimination of jobs has many workers concerned about job [[security]], but [[AI]] is more likely to lead to job creation.
- **Health tracking:** The pandemic brought contact tracing into the mainstream. Is it ethical to track the health status of people and how will that impact the limitations we place on them?

- **Bias in [[AI]] technology:** Technology is built by programmers and inherits the bias of its creators because humans inherently have bias. “Technology is inherently flawed. Does it even matter who developed the algorithms? [[AI]] systems learn to make decisions based on training and coding data, which can be tainted by human bias or reflect historical or social inequities,” [according to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/04/01/reviewing-the-top-ai-ethics-issues-that-could-affect-the-future-of-women-in-tech-and-how-to-combat-them/?sh=9df88f221755). Leading [[AI]] developer Google has even experienced an issue where [[[AI]] software believes male nurses and female historians do not exist](https://algorithmwatch.org/en/google-translate-gender-bias/).

### Autonomous Technology

Self-driving cars, robotic weapons and drones for service are no longer a thing of the future—they’re a thing of the present and they come with ethical dilemmas. Robotic machines in place of human soldiers is a very real possibility, along with self-driving cars and package delivery via unmanned drone.

Autonomous technology packs a punch when it comes to business potential, but there is significant concern that comes with allowing programmed technology to operate seemingly without needed oversight. It’s a frequently mentioned ethical concern that we trust our technology too much without fully understanding it.

## Ethical Practices in Technology

Unlike business ethics, ethical technology is about ensuring there is a moral relationship that exists between technology and users.

### Respect for Employees and Customers

Businesses that engage in ethical technology have a firm moral sense of employee rights and customer protections. Data is valuable, but the employees and customers who power your business are undoubtedly your greatest asset. Take care to always observe responsible protections for employees and customers to practice ethical technology.

### Moral Use of Data and Resources

Data is undoubtedly something of value for businesses. It allows companies to target their marketing strategies and refine product offerings, but it can also be an invasive use of privacy bringing many ethical considerations to the forefront. [[Data protection]] measures and compliance procedures can [[help]] ensure that data isn’t leaked or used inappropriately.

### Responsible Adoption of Disruptive Tech

Digital growth is a business reality. Disruptive tech often isn’t just a way to outpace the competition—it’s the only way to break even. But embracing new technologies doesn’t have to coincide with an ethical challenge. Do your due diligence to ensure that the technology you adopt has protections in place and you’ll be well on your way to practicing ethical tech.

### Create a Culture of Responsibility

Ultimately, we need to create a culture of responsibility within technology. If the information technology workforce and industry giants believe they are responsible for the safe and ethical usage of technology, then we will see more governance and fair use of data.

## Emerging ethical dilemmas in science and technology

New ethical problems regarding the use of science and technology are always arising. When is it right to use science and technology to apply to real-life scenarios and when does it impede human rights?

- **Health tracking and the digital twin dilemma:** Should organizations be able to create your twin in code and experiment on it to advance healthcare initiatives? And when does that become a practice of exploitation?

- **Neurotechnology and privacy:** Neurotechnology is nothing new, but [new advances allowing the use of technology to gradually change behavior or thought patterns](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/technology-brain-activity-read-change-thoughts-privacy-ethics) poses severe questions about privacy.

- **Genetic engineering:** While possessing great potential for human health and the recovery from damaging genetic mutations, there are considerable ethical considerations that surround the [[editing]] of the human genome.

- **Weaponization of technology:** While there is a lessened chance for loss of life, there are sincere ethical problems with weaponizing technology. At what point do we trust our technology to fight a war for us?

Ethical decisions in technology should not be taken lightly. If we believe that technology can [[help]] to solve the world’s problems, addressing the ethics involved is the only way to us get there.
