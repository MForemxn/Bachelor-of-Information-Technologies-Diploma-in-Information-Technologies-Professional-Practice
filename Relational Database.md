## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
A relational [[database]] organises [[data]] into tables with rows and columns, enabling efficient [[data]] management, querying, and relationships between datasets.

## OVERVIEW:
A relational [[database]] is a type of [[database]] that stores and provides access to [[data]] points that are related to one another. It uses a structure that allows us to identify and access [[data]] in relation to another piece of [[data]] in the [[database]]. This model organises [[data]] into tables (or relations) consisting of rows and columns, where each row represents a unique record and each column represents a field within the record. The relational model is based on the theory of relational algebra and provides a powerful framework for managing large amounts of [[data]]. Relational databases use [[Structured Query Language (SQL)]] for querying and maintaining the [[database]]. They are widely used in various applications, from business and finance to healthcare and education, due to their efficiency, [[flexibility]], and ability to handle complex queries and transactions. Key features include [[data]] [[integrity]], consistency, and the ability to establish relationships between different [[data]] tables through foreign [[keys]].
