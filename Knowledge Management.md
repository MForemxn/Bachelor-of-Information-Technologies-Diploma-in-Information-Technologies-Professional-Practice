## Knowledge Management Cycle
- Knowledge creation: Knowledge is created as people determine new ways of doing things or develop know-how.
- Capture knowledge: New knowledge must be identified as valuable and be represented in a reasonable way.
- Refine knowledge: New knowledge must be placed in context so that it is actionable. This is where tacit qualities (human insights) must be captured along with explicit facts.
- Knowledge storage: Useful knowledge must then be stored in a reasonable format in a knowledge repository so that others in the organisation can access it.
- Manage knowledge: Like a library, the knowledge must be kept current. It must be reviewed regularly to verify that it is relevant and accurate.
- Disseminate knowledge: Knowledge must be made available in a useful format to anyone in the organisation who needs it, anywhere and anytime.
> KMS refer to a class of [[information systems]] applied to support and enhance the organisational [[processes]] of knowledge creation, capture, refine, storage, manage , and disseminate.
