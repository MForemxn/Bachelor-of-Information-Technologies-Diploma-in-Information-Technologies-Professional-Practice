## Definition
Input validation is the process of ensuring that a program operates on clean, correct, and useful data. It involves checking every inputted data to ensure it conforms to the expected format, type, and range before using it in a program or application.

## Importance
- **[[Security]]**: Prevents malicious data from causing harm to the system or application.
- **Data [[Integrity]]**: Ensures that only valid and useful data is processed, maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the system.
- **User Experience**: Helps in guiding users to input data in the correct format, improving overall usability.

## Types of Input Validation
1. **Client-Side Validation**: Performed on the client side, usually within a web browser before sending data to the server. It provides immediate feedback but is not secure on its own.
2. **Server-Side Validation**: Performed on the server, providing a secure check of the data. It is crucial for [[security]] and data [[integrity]].
3. **Static Validation**: Checks the data against a set of rules for format, type, and length without any dynamic reference to external data or [[state]].
4. **Dynamic Validation**: Involves checking the input against a dynamically changing environment or against external data sources.

## Techniques
- **Type Checking**: Ensuring the data is of the correct type (e.g., string, integer).
- **Format Checking**: Verifying the data follows a specific format (e.g., email addresses).
- **Range Checking**: Ensuring the data falls within a certain range (e.g., age between 0 and 120).
- **List Checking**: Validating the data against a predefined list of values.
- **Sanitization**: Removing or replacing characters in the data that are not allowed or could be harmful.

## Best Practices
- **Whitelist Approach**: Only allow data that meets specific criteria, rather than trying to block known bad inputs.
- **Use Existing Libraries**: Leverage existing, well-tested libraries for input validation to reduce the risk of errors.
- **Validate on Both Sides**: Implement both client-side and server-side validation for better [[security]] and user experience.
- **Provide Clear Feedback**: When validation fails, provide clear and constructive feedback to the user.
- **Regularly Update Validation Rules**: Keep validation rules updated with the latest [[security]] practices and standards.

## Conclusion
Input validation is a critical component of secure and reliable software development. By ensuring that only properly formatted and safe data is accepted, developers can protect their applications from a wide range of attacks and errors, ultimately leading to a more secure and user-friendly experience.
