do i need to have the money to purchase these apple products, or is it a credit system? and how long will i be without that money?

ChatGPT

ChatGPT

Yes, you will need to have the funds available to initially purchase the Apple products yourself. Here's how it works:

1. **Fund Availability**: You must have the money available on your Crypto.com Visa Card or another form of payment to make the initial purchase at the Apple Store. This means you need to either load money onto your Visa Card or ensure you have a sufficient credit limit if it's a credit card.
    
2. **Making the Purchase**: Use your Crypto.com Visa Card to buy the Apple products. You pay upfront, just like any normal transaction.
    
3. **Reimbursement Period**: After making your purchase, you will need to wait for the reimbursement, which will be in the form of CRO tokens credited to your Crypto Wallet within the Crypto.com App. The terms state that the reimbursement will occur within three months after the promotion period ends.
    

### How long will you be without the money?

- You will be without the money from the time you make the purchase until you receive the CRO reimbursement. This period can be up to three months after the promotion ends, depending on when you made your purchase and how quickly Crypto.com processes the reimbursement.

This setup does require you to have the financial flexibility to cover the initial cost and wait for the reimbursement.

what is staking? or lockup?

ChatGPT

ChatGPT

In the context of cryptocurrencies like those offered by Crypto.com, "staking" or "lockup" refers to the process where you commit your cryptocurrency assets for a set period to support the operations of a blockchain network. Here’s how it specifically relates to using services like the Crypto.com Visa Card:

### Staking

- **Purpose**: Staking involves holding a certain amount of cryptocurrency (in this case, CRO tokens) in your wallet to participate in maintaining the operations of the blockchain network. By staking your coins, you help secure the network and process transactions.
- **Rewards**: As compensation for locking up your funds and supporting the network, stakers often receive rewards, which can be in the form of additional coins or tokens.

### Lockup

- **Requirement for Benefits**: For Crypto.com Visa Card users, a lockup of CRO tokens is required to qualify for higher tier cards. This means you need to commit a certain amount of CRO by holding it in your Crypto.com account for a predetermined period.
- **Card Benefits**: The amount of CRO you lock up, and the duration for which you lock it up, can affect the benefits you receive from your card. Higher tiers, which require larger amounts of CRO to be locked up, typically offer greater perks like higher cashback rates, exclusive services, and bonuses like the Apple gear rebate.

### Practical Example

When you apply for a Crypto.com Visa Card, you might choose a specific tier like Ruby Steel, Jade Green, etc. Each of these tiers has a minimum CRO lockup requirement. For example:

- To get a Ruby Steel card, you might need to lock up $400 worth of CRO.
- For a Jade Green card, the lockup might be around $4,000 worth of CRO.

During the lockup period, you cannot withdraw these CRO tokens. Once the lockup period ends, you can choose to withdraw your CRO or continue staking to enjoy ongoing card benefits and potential staking rewards.

This mechanism not only supports the underlying blockchain's functionality and security but also ties the users more closely to the Crypto.com ecosystem, encouraging longer-term investment and usage of the platform's services.

right. i am an australian (18y/o) and am looking to get a credit card… i can guarantee that each purchase i make will be paid back within a week of making it, but i am looking for an option with good perks and cashback on spending. what are my options?

ChatGPT

ChatGPT

In Australia, there are several credit card options that offer good perks and cashback rewards, especially suited to someone who pays off their balance quickly like you plan to. Here’s a breakdown of some potential options that are popular for their rewards and benefits:

### 1. **Low Fee or No Annual Fee Cards**

These cards are suitable if you're starting out with credit cards and want to minimize costs:

- **Examples**: Many banks such as ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, and Westpac offer low or no annual fee cards that might have introductory cashback offers or rewards points.

### 2. **Cashback Credit Cards**

These cards offer cash rebates on spending, which can be very rewarding if you use your card frequently:

- **American Express Essential Credit Card**: Offers cashback and also has no annual fee, which could be appealing for a new cardholder.
- **Westpac Low Rate Card**: Sometimes has promotions for new customers like cashback offers when certain spending thresholds are met within the first few months.

### 3. **Rewards Credit Cards**

If you're interested in a broader range of perks (like travel rewards, shopping deals):

- **Qantas Premier Platinum Card**: Good for earning Qantas Points on everyday spending, with additional perks like travel credits and insurance covers.
- **Velocity Platinum Card from American Express**: Offers points on purchases that can be redeemed for flights, upgrades, or other goods.

### 4. **Student Credit Cards**

These are specifically designed for young adults or students and usually have lower credit limits and tailored perks:

- **Commonwealth Bank Student Credit Card**: Has a low annual fee and features that match a student’s lifestyle.
- **ANZ First Student Credit Card**: Offers manageable credit limits with a low annual fee.

### 5. **Crypto-linked Credit Cards**

Given your interest in Crypto.com's promotion, you might also consider crypto-linked cards, though they are less common in Australia:

- **Crypto.com Visa Card**: It provides cashback in the form of CRO tokens, as discussed earlier. The perks depend on the amount of CRO you stake.

### Tips for Choosing Your First Credit Card:

- **Understand Fees**: Look at annual fees, foreign transaction fees, and other charges.
- **Interest Rates**: Since you plan to pay off the balance quickly, the interest rate might not be as crucial, but it’s good to know the rates just in case.
- **Perks that Match Your Spending**: Consider where you spend most often (e.g., groceries, online shopping, travel) and pick a card that rewards those expenditures.
- **Credit Limit**: As a new user, starting with a lower credit limit can help manage finances better and avoid large debt.

Be sure to read all terms and conditions before applying for a card. It's also useful to check independent reviews and maybe even discuss options with a financial advisor or the bank’s customer service to make an informed choice.
