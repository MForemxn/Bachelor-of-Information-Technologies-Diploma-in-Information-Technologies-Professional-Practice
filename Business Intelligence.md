Business Intelligence (BI) refers to the technologies, applications, strategies, and practices used to collect, integrate, analyze, and present business information. The aim of BI is to support and improve [[decision]]-making within an organization. It involves the use of data analytics, data visualization, data mining, and [[business analytics]] to identify, develop, and create new strategic business opportunities.

Key components of Business Intelligence include:

1. **Data Collection and Storage**: This involves gathering data from various sources, including internal systems (like sales, finance, and HR) and external sources (like market research and social media), and storing it in databases or data warehouses for easy access and analysis.

2. **Data Management**: Ensuring the quality, consistency, and [[security]] of data across the organization. This includes data cleaning, data integration, and data governance practices.

3. **[[Data Analysis]]**: Using statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and data mining techniques to understand current trends, predict future outcomes, and derive actionable insights from the data.

4. **Reporting and Visualization**: Presenting data in an easily understandable format through reports, dashboards, and data visualizations. This helps stakeholders to quickly grasp the insights and make informed decisions.

5. **Performance Management**: Tracking and managing the performance of business strategies and [[processes]] against defined goals and objectives, often through the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

The ultimate goal of Business Intelligence is to enable businesses to make better decisions by providing them with accurate, up-to-date, and relevant information. By leveraging BI, organizations can identify inefficiencies, spot market trends, understand customer behavior, and gain a competitive edge in their industry.
