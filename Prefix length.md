# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Prefix length, expressed as a slash followed by a number, indicates the number of bits used for the network portion in a [[subnet mask]].

# OVERVIEW:
Prefix length is a notation used in IP networking to specify the number of bits in a [[subnet mask]] that are dedicated to the network portion of an [[IP address]]. It is represented as a slash (/) followed by a number, such as /24, which means that the first 24 bits of the [[subnet mask]] are set to one (1), defining the network part of the address. This notation is a concise way to express subnet masks, replacing the traditional dot-decimal format like 255.255.255.0. The prefix length is crucial for determining the size of a network and the number of available host addresses. A shorter prefix length means more host addresses, while a longer prefix length indicates fewer host addresses but more subnets. Understanding prefix length is essential for network design, configuration, and efficient [[IP address]] management.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Prefix length specifies network bits in a [[subnet mask]].
2. Expressed as a slash followed by a number (e.g., /24).
3. Replaces traditional dot-decimal [[subnet mask]] notation.
4. Determines network size and available host addresses.
5. Shorter prefix length allows more host addresses.
6. Longer prefix length provides more subnets.
7. Essential for network design and configuration.
8. Simplifies understanding of subnet masks.
9. Crucial for efficient [[IP address]] management.
10. Used in both IPv4 and IPv6 networking.
