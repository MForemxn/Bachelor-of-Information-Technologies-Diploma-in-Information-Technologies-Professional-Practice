## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Key elements of planning include strategy, tactics, goals, objectives, constraints, and metrics, which collectively guide and measure organisational efforts.

## OVERVIEW:
Effective planning within an organisation involves several key elements that work together to guide and measure efforts towards achieving desired outcomes. Strategy refers to the overarching plan that outlines how an organisation will achieve its long-term goals. Tactics are the specific actions or steps taken to implement the strategy. Goals are broad, long-term aims that provide direction, while objectives are specific, measurable steps that [[help]] achieve these goals. Constraints are the limitations or restrictions that may impact the planning [[Process]], such as budget, time, or resources. Metrics are the standards or measures used to assess progress and performance against the set objectives. By integrating these elements, organisations can create a comprehensive plan that aligns with their vision, ensures efficient resource utilisation, and facilitates continuous improvement.
