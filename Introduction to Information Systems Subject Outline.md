The subject coordinator can be contacted by email or phone if you have matters of a personal nature to discuss (e.g.
illness, study problems, team problems, team reassignments) or want to request an appointment outside the normal
consultation hours. All emails must bear a meaningful description in the ‘subject’ box, beginning with subject number (
e.g., 31266 team problems, 31266 request for late submission due to illness).

# Subject description

This subject describes today's business environment and how technology is integrated into business, government and
community systems. It covers the trends towards greater mobility, greater complexity, globalisation and business
networking, and ways that technology can deliver services to improve business competitiveness in an increasingly global
and networked environment. It describes the role of [[information systems]] (IS) for better business management and the
formation of business networks. Real-world case studies are presented to understand the role of IS in obtaining and
maintaining competitive advantage. This introductory subject explains activities used to develop, implement and maintain
IS. Techniques for building effective team collaboration skills and relationship skills are demonstrated in this
subject. In addition, ethics, privacy and information [[Security]] are highlighted. In this subject, students learn to apply
theoretical knowledge to solve practical situations, learn to generate new ideas and learn how to work together to
develop team skills.

# Subject learning objectives (SLOs)

Upon successful completion of this subject students should be able to:

1. Identify business, organizational and society environment to propose types of IS for obtaining and maintaining
   competitive advantage. (B.1)

2. Demonstrate data management approaches for implementing [[knowledge management]] systems in organisations. (D.1)

3. Discuss key concepts relating to telecommunication and networking. (D.1)

4. Describe the process of acquiring [[information systems]] and applications. (D.1)

5. Identify ethical issues in the IS context to propose recommendations. (B.1)

# Course intended learning outcomes (CILOs)

This subject also contributes specifically to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (
CILOs):

Socially Responsible: FEIT graduates identify, engage, interpret and analyse stakeholder needs and cultural
perspectives, establish priorities and goals, and identify constraints, uncertainties and risks (social, ethical,
cultural, legislative, environmental, economics etc.) to define the system requirements. (B.1)

legislative, environmental, economics etc.) to define the system requirements. (B.1)

Technically Proficient: FEIT graduates apply abstraction, mathematics and discipline fundamentals, software, tools and
techniques to evaluate, implement and operate systems. (D.1)

# Teaching and learning strategies

Students will learn through 12 online lectures (1.5 hours) and 10 face-to-face and/or online tutorials (1.5 hours,
starting from week 2) over 12 weeks.

**Lectures**

Lecture notes for each week will be made available on Canvas. Students are expected to download the notes, engage with
new content and make use of it in the lectures. The lecturer will explain each topic based on the Canvas materials and
encourage students to clarify their interpretations through verbal interaction and feedback.

**Tutorials**

Tutorials are designed to engage students in learning activities, encourage them to collaborate with other students,
learn from each other’s ideas through group discussion and peer review, and to provide opportunities for additional
feedback on teaching materials that inform the assessment tasks. Tutorial classes will involve a range of planned
activities such as testing students’ understanding using weekly in-class quizzes, problem-solving activities, and group
activities and discussions. Students are required to learn concepts covered in the week’s lecture topic before each
tutorial.

Weekly tutorial questions (case study questions and discussion questions) and instructions for each class will be made
available on Canvas to enable students to engage with the content, draft their answers, then actively and
collaboratively complete the questions in the tutorials. Students will form collaborative groups to discuss their
answers with their peers, and complete problem-solving activities, analyse case studies and answer discussion questions
in teams.

Students are encouraged to come up with ideas and present them to the whole class, and are expected to evaluate each
other’s responses; this regular peer feedback will [[help]] students learn. Constant feedback as part of the tutorial will
be provided by extending the class collaborative discussion with reflective questions from the tutor.

The following applies to Bachelor of Computing Science students only.

It is a requirement of this subject that students complete OPELA. Students who receive a Basic grade in OPELA are
required to attend 80% of the Language Development Tutorials in order to pass the subject. Students who do not complete
the OPELA and/or do not attend 80% of the Language Development Tutorials will receive a Fail X grade.

# Additional information

Students are strongly encouraged to attend lectures and tutorials on a regular basis and contribute to class discussions
and activities. Students are reminded to complete the readings for each week prior to attending the lecture/tutorial
time in order to maximise their learning opportunity.

If a student has any issues in relation to any topic or assessment item, they need to raise this immediately with the
relevant party (e.g. Their Tutor/ Subject coordinator) and not wait until the assessment due time or the end of the
session.

# Assessment

**Group Work Issues:**

Many students would have had some experience with working in teams. In this subject, it is aimed that the group
assessments such as assignment two and group activities in assignment three, will assist students in learning how to
work together and in gaining team skills and knowledge. If any student has trouble with the operation of their team,
they need to ask their tutor for advice immediately as problems arise.

**U:PASS**

UTS Peer Assisted Study Success is a voluntary “study session” where you will be studying the subject with other
students in a group. It is led by a student who has previously achieved a distinction or high distinction in the subject
area, and who has a good WAM. Leaders will prepare activities for you to work on in groups based on the content you are
learning in lectures and tutorials. It’s really relaxed, friendly, and informal. Because the leader is a student just
like you, they understand what it’s like to study the subject and how to do well, and they can pass those tips along to
you. Students also say it’s a great way to meet new people and a “guaranteed study hour”.

You can sign up for U:PASS sessions via U:PASS website [http://tinyurl.com/upass2017](http://tinyurl.com/upass2017) Note
that sign up is not open until week 2, as it’s voluntary and only students who want to go should sign up.

If you have any questions or concerns about U:PASS, please contact Georgina at upass@uts.edu.au, or check out
the [website](http://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/upass/upass).

# Assessment: faculty procedures and advice

**Marking criteria**

Marking criteria for each assessment task will be available on the Learning Management
System: [Canvas](https://canvas.uts.edu.au/).

**Extensions**

When, due to extenuating circumstances, you are unable to submit or present an assessment task on time, please contact
your subject coordinator before the assessment task is due to discuss an extension. Extensions may be granted up to a
maximum of 5 days (120 hours) for standard students or up to a maximum of 7 days (168 hours)
for [UTS Online students](https://www.uts.edu.au/utsonline-extension-form). In all cases you should have extensions
confirmed in writing.

**Special consideration**

If you believe your performance in an assessment item or exam has been adversely affected by circumstances beyond your
control, such as a serious illness, loss or bereavement, hardship, trauma, or exceptional employment demands, you may be
eligible to apply
for [Special Consideration](http://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/managing-your-course/classes-and-assessment/special-circumstances/special).

**Late penalty**

For Graded [[subjects]]:

Work submitted late without an approved extension is subject to a late penalty of 10 per cent of the total available
marks deducted per calendar day that the assessment is overdue (e.g. if an assignment is out of 40 marks, and is
submitted (up to) 24 hours after the deadline without an extension, the student will have four marks deducted from their
awarded mark). Work submitted after five calendar days is not accepted and a mark of zero is awarded.

For some assessment tasks a late penalty may not be appropriate – these are clearly indicated in the subject outline.
Such assessments receive a mark of zero if not completed by/on the specified date. Examples include:

a. weekly online tests or laboratory work worth a small proportion of the subject mark, or

b. online quizzes where answers are released to students on completion, or

c. professional assessment tasks, where the intention is to create an authentic assessment that has an absolute
submission date, or

d. take-[[home]] papers that are assessed during a defined time period, or

e. pass/fail assessment tasks.

For Pass/Fail [[subjects]]:

Work submitted late without an approved extension will only be assessed at the subject coordinator’s discretion.
Students who do not submit assessment tasks by the due dates may be referred to the Responsible Academic Officer
under [Student Rule 3.8.2](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/rules/uts-student-rules/section-3), and a fail
result may be recorded for the subject.

Request a review of a result

If you believe an error may have been made in the calculation of your result in an assessment task or the final result
for the subject, it is possible
to [request a review of a result](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/managing-your-course/classes-and-assessment/results/request-review-result)
with the Subject Coordinator within five (5) working days of the date of release of the result.

# [[Academic integrity]]

[[Academic integrity]] is about demonstrating honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility in your studies and
assessments. Studying at UTS and being part of our community means maintaining these values and acting with academic
integrity at all times. This is in line with expectations for professional practice
in [Engineering](https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/sites/default/files/2022-08/code-ethics-guidelines-professional-conduct-2022.pdf)
and [IT](https://www.acs.org.au/content/dam/acs/CodeOfProfessionalEthics_Mar_2023.pdf).

**Guide to practising [[academic integrity]]**

As a UTS student, when you create something original, credit others and collaborate with care, you act with academic
integrity:

Create something original. This means doing all your own work from start to finish, submitting work that is original for
that assessment and being honest about any data or results.

Credit others. You need to acknowledge and reference the source of any ideas, data or materials you use or adapt in your
work.

Collaborate with care. Make sure you do group work according to the guidelines from your tutor, lecturer or supervisor,
study with your classmates and friends with care and keep your assessment and study notes just for you.

If you are feeling confused about [[academic integrity]], it’s okay, just ask! We are here to [[help]] you understand academic
integrity and do your assessments with confidence:

**Generative [[AI]] (GenAI) and [[academic integrity]]**

In the Faculty of Engineering and IT [[subjects]], unless otherwise instructed by the Subject Coordinator, you are permitted
to use [[AI]] technologies, such as ChatGPT or DALL-E, to generate materials for background research and self-study. Only
assistive use is permitted. Content generated by [[AI]] technologies or other sources presented as your own work is
considered to be academic misconduct as per
the [UTS Student Rules on misconduct](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/rules/uts-student-rules/section-16).

There are a few things you must do to ensure you are maintaining [[academic integrity]]:

Check the rules for if and how you can use GenAI in your [[subjects]] and assessments via this subject outline or your
subject sites in Canvas (rules will differ between [[subjects]], so make sure you check each subject). If you are not sure,
check with your tutor, lecturer or subject coordinator.

Understand [how to use GenAI ethically](https://studyguides.lib.uts.edu.au/genai/home).

Unless instructed otherwise by the Subject
Coordinator, [reference and acknowledge](https://studyguides.lib.uts.edu.au/genai/referencing) the use of GenAI in your
work, providing details of the type of interactions and extent of usage.

**[[Academic integrity]] breaches**

A breach of [[academic integrity]] is also known as 'academic misconduct'. A breach occurs if you engage in behaviour that
undermines [[academic integrity]], such as plagiarism and cheating (
see [Student Rule 16.2](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/rules/uts-student-rules/section-16)).

Plagiarism can take a number of forms including but not limited to:

copying any section of text, no matter how brief, from a book, journal, article or other written source, such as coding,
without duly acknowledging the source. copying any map, diagram, table or figure without duly acknowledging the source.
paraphrasing or otherwise using the ideas of another author without duly acknowledging the source. re-using sections of
verbatim text without using quote marks to indicate the text was copied from the source (even if a reference is given).

Cheating includes, but is not limited to:

submitting work that is not your own, copying from another student, recycling another student's work, recycling
previously submitted work, and working with another student in the same cohort in a manner that exceeds the boundaries
of legitimate cooperation purchasing an assignment from a website and submitting it as original work. requesting or
paying someone else to write original work, such as an assignment, essay or computer program, and submitting it as
original work. manipulating an assessment to avoid the UTS detection software or using a third-party service to bypass
the UTS detection software. using material or equipment that is not specified on an examination paper for use in the
examination.

Students who allow their assessment to be copied, share their assessment on external platforms, or provide other
students with the answers to assessments are also subject to student misconduct Rules.

These are all serious forms of misconduct
and [penalties apply](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/academic-support/academic-integrity/consequences-plagiarism-and-cheating).

To [[help]] ensure [[academic integrity]], assessments that you submit electronically may be subject to similarity detection
software. Your work must be submitted in a format able to be assessed by the software (e.g. doc, pdf ([[text files]]), rtf,
html). Under
the [Coursework Assessments Policy](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/policies/uts-policy/coursework-assessments-policy) (
section 4.27), vivas or other invigilated tasks may be used to confirm or clarify your work and/or marks, and to verify
achievement of learning outcomes.

# Academic liaison officer

[Academic liaison officers](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/students-with-accessibility-requirements/accessibility-service/services-and-assistance/academic-liaison-officers-alos/alo-list) (
ALOs) are academic staff in each faculty who assist students experiencing difficulties in their studies due to:
disability and/or an ongoing health condition; carer responsibilities (e.g. being a primary carer for small children or
a family member with a disability); and pregnancy.

ALOs are responsible for approving adjustments to assessment arrangements for students in these categories. Students who
require adjustments due to disability and/or an ongoing health condition are requested to discuss their situation with
an accessibility consultant at
the [Accessibility Service](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/students-with-accessibility-requirements/accessibility-service)
before speaking to the relevant ALO.
