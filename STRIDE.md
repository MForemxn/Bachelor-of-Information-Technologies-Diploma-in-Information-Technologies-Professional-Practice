# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
STRIDE is a threat modeling framework used to identify and categorize potential [[security]] threats in software systems, focusing on six key areas.

# OVERVIEW:
STRIDE is an acronym used in threat modeling to [[help]] identify and categorize potential [[security]] threats in software systems. Developed by Microsoft, STRIDE stands for:
- Spoofing
- Tampering
- Repudiation
- Information Disclosure
- Denial of Service
- Elevation of Privilege. 

Each category represents a different type of threat that can compromise the [[security]] of a system. Spoofing involves impersonating another user or system, while Tampering refers to unauthorized [[data]] modification. Repudiation deals with the ability to deny actions, Information Disclosure involves unauthorized [[data]] access, Denial of Service aims to disrupt service [[availability]], and Elevation of Privilege occurs when a user gains unauthorized access to higher-level functions. By using STRIDE, developers and [[security]] professionals can systematically analyze potential vulnerabilities and implement appropriate [[security]] measures to mitigate these threats, ultimately enhancing the overall [[security]] posture of the system.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. STRIDE is a threat modeling framework for identifying [[security]] threats.
2. Developed by Microsoft to enhance software [[security]].
3. **Spoofing** involves impersonating users or systems.
4. **Tampering** refers to unauthorized [[data]] modification.
5. **Repudiation** allows denial of actions taken.
6. **Information Disclosure** involves unauthorized [[data]] access.
7. **Denial of Service** disrupts service [[availability]].
8. **Elevation of Privilege** grants unauthorized access to higher functions.
9. Helps systematically analyze and mitigate vulnerabilities.
10. Enhances overall [[security]] posture of software systems.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. STRIDE helps identify and categorize [[security]] threats in software.
2. Each letter represents a distinct type of threat.
3. It aids in systematically analyzing vulnerabilities.
4. Implementing STRIDE enhances [[system security]].
5. Understanding STRIDE is crucial for effective threat modeling.
