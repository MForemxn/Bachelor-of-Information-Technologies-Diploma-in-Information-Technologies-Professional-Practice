# CSS and HTML
### Overview

- The presentation starts by situating CSS within the broader context of [[web page development]], alongside HTML/XHTML, [[web applications]], online media, file sharing, communications, search engines, human-computer interaction (HCI), the history of the internet, and [[security]] and [[encryption]].

### Problem with HTML

- HTML inherently defines both the structure and presentation of web pages. However, it's best to separate these aspects to accommodate more device types, ensure different rendering (e.g., printing), and enhance accessibility (e.g., text to voice).

### Structure and Presentation

- **Structure** defines the components and areas on a page (e.g., top, middle section, footer), while **presentation** determines the style of the information (e.g., color, size, font).

### Style Sheets and HTML Presentation

- Style sheets externalize presentation aspects (color, font, etc.) from HTML, moving towards deprecating many presentational tags in HTML (e.g., `<font>`, `<center>`, `<strong>`, `<u>`), as their use is discouraged.

### CSS Definition and Purpose

- CSS is defined as a simple mechanism for adding style to web documents, allowing the separation of style from structure and defining the behavior of each tag or content container.

### CSS Standards and Responsibility

- The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defines web standards, including CSS. CSS has evolved from Level 1 through CSS 2.2 to CSS 3, with the latter not being a new version but an extension of CSS 2.2 through backward-compatible specifications.

### CSS Syntax and Selectors

- CSS rules are defined with selectors (tag, #id, .class, inline), properties, and values. This allows for the customization of HTML elements' styles across a webpage or the entire site.

### Flexibility with CSS

- Tags like `<div>` and `<span>` provide flexibility in styling sections of a page or inline content differently.

### Implementing CSS

- CSS can be implemented in four ways: imported, linked (recommended as the best way), embedded, and inline, with an emphasis on avoiding inline styles for maintainability and separation of concerns.

### CSS Positioning

- CSS facilitates the positioning of HTML elements anywhere on a screen, offering more control over layout without the need for tables or frames, and is essential for Web 2.0 applications.

### Cascading and Precedence

- Styles cascade in a specific order of precedence, from browser default settings to user settings, external CSS, imported CSS, embedded CSS, inline CSS, and finally HTML tag attributes.

### Benefits of CSS

- Using CSS offers benefits like separation of style from structure, cleaner code, uniformity across pages, more power and flexibility, and better code reuse.

### Resources and Further Learning

- The presentation concludes with references for further exploration of CSS capabilities, including official W3C resources, learning sites like W3Schools, and other articles showcasing advanced CSS techniques.
