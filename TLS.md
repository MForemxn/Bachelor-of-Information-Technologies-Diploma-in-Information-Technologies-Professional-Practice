# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:  
[[Transport Layer]] [[Security]] (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network.

# OVERVIEW:  
[[Transport Layer]] [[Security]] (TLS) is a widely adopted protocol that ensures privacy and [[data]] [[integrity]] between two communicating applications over [[the Internet]]. It is the successor to the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol and is used to encrypt [[data]] transmitted over networks, protecting it from eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery. TLS is commonly used in web browsers, email, messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP) applications. It operates at the [[transport layer]] and uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric [[cryptography]] to secure [[data]]. The protocol involves a handshake [[process]] where the client and server agree on [[encryption]] methods and exchange [[keys]]. TLS supports various [[encryption]] algorithms and provides [[authentication]] through [[digital certificates]]. Its [[flexibility]] and [[security]] features make it a critical component in safeguarding online communications.
