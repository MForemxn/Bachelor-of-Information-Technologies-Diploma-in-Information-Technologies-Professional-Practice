# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Classful and classless addressing are methods for allocating IP addresses, with classful using fixed blocks and classless allowing flexible subnetting.

# OVERVIEW:
Classful addressing is an [[IP address]] allocation method that divides the address space into fixed classes (A, B, C, D, and E), each with a predefined block size and network-to-host ratio. [[Class]] A addresses have a large number of host addresses, while [[Class]] C addresses have fewer. This rigid structure often led to inefficient use of IP space, as networks could not be tailored to specific size requirements. In contrast, classless addressing, introduced with Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), allows for more flexible allocation by using variable-length subnet masking (VLSM). CIDR eliminates the fixed [[class]] boundaries, enabling networks to be divided into subnets of varying sizes, optimizing [[IP address]] usage and reducing wastage. Classless addressing is now the standard, as it supports efficient routing and better accommodates the diverse needs of modern networks.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Classful addressing uses fixed [[IP address]] classes.
2. Classes A, B, and C have predefined block sizes.
3. Classful addressing often leads to IP wastage.
4. Classless addressing uses CIDR for [[flexibility]].
5. CIDR allows variable-length subnet masking (VLSM).
6. Classless addressing optimizes [[IP address]] usage.
7. Supports efficient routing and network [[scalability]].
8. Classful addressing is largely obsolete.
9. Classless addressing accommodates diverse network needs.
10. CIDR is the current standard for IP allocation.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Classful addressing uses fixed classes, leading to inefficiency.
2. Classless addressing allows flexible subnetting with CIDR.
3. CIDR optimizes IP usage and supports modern networks.
4. Classless is the standard due to its efficiency.
5. Understanding both helps in grasping IP allocation evolution.
