### Handbook description

This subject extends the work done in the prerequisite subject. Students who are not interested in networking as a career develop a clear model of how networks can impact network based applications. Students who are interested in a career in networking practice or research develop sound knowledge and skills to pursue a networking specialisation. Students learn the role of [[routing]] protocols and how to compare them; how to design construct and implement small to medium-sized intranets; and how to perform basic management and security tasks. The role of TCP/IP, ICMP and other protocols in IP networks are evaluated. Students also learn how Cisco routers are used for the practical work.

### Subject objectives

Upon successful completion of this subject students should be able to:

|Objective Number|Objective|
|---|---|
|01.|Understand and describe basic switching concepts and the operation of Cisco switches|
|02.|Understand and describe the purpose and types of access control lists (ACLs)|
|03.|Configure, monitor, and troubleshoot ACLs for IPv4 and IPv6|
|04.|Understand and describe the operations and benefits of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol ([[DHCP]]) and Domain Name System ([[DNS]]) for IPv4 and IPv6|
|05.|Understand and describe the operations and benefits of [[Network Address Translation]] ([[NAT]])|
|06.|Configure and troubleshoot [[NAT]] operations|
|07.|Understand and describe enhanced switching technologies such as VLANs and 802.1q|
|08.|Configure and troubleshoot basic operations of a small switched network|
|09.|Understand and describe the purpose, nature, and operations of a router, [[routing]] tables, and the route lookup process|
|10.|Configure and verify static [[routing]] and default [[routing]]|
|11.|Understand and describe how VLANs create logically separate networks and how [[routing]] occurs between them|
|12.|Understand and describe dynamic [[routing]] protocols, distance vector [[routing]] protocols, and link-state [[routing]] protocols|
|13.|Configure and troubleshoot basic operations of routers in a small routed network: ? [[Routing]] Information Protocol (RIPv1 and RIPv2) ? Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol (single-area OSPF)|
|14.|Configure and troubleshoot VLANs and inter-VLAN [[routing]]|

### Teaching and learning strategies

Normal class contact time is comprised of **three hours** tutorial/laboratory session per week. In the laboratory a workshop approach is used which combines learning by doing small group and whole class discussion, a short presentation, web research, online activities, hands-on activities, question and answer sessions, and online tests with immediate feedback. It is expected that students will need to spend an additional three hours in self-directed study for each lab session.

An online discussion forum is used to disseminate information to all students, and to allow students to pose questions, and more importantly, to answer each others’ questions. Students are expected to log into the forum on a frequent basis to read messages and to engage in dialogue on the subject matter.

**Students are expected to pre-read all chapters** (online version or hard copy text) before they are covered in each lecture. Further, careful notes made at this time will greatly assist with the written exam and the online final exams. During lab sessions students should make careful notes in their Engineering Journals which will be very helpful in the skills based assessments. The final written exam questions will also come from these sources.

The workload for this subject will require students to exercise considerable diligence and to strive for efficient utilisation of class time and laboratory facilities. Accordingly, **all computer activities which are not directly and expressly related to the curriculum are strictly prohibited in all networking labs**. Any detected infringement will result in immediate expulsion from the laboratory.

### Required texts

1. The primary source of information for this subject will be **online course material**.
2. All students enrolled for this subject will be given access to _CCNA [[Routing]] and Switching 5.0: [[Routing and Switching Essentials]]_. through the Cisco Networking Academy website ([http://www.netacad.com](http://www.netacad.com/)). Note that Cisco Networking Academy website site contain all the online course material. The Cisco Networking Academy site also contains additional learning resources, However, both the Online Chapter Quizzes and the Online Final Exam will only be available via the Cisco Networking Academy website.
3. Other subject documents and course materials, such as subject outlines, lecture notes, assignments, additional information about labs and assessments, as well as comments and answers to questions common to all students, will be distributed via **UTS Online** ([http://online.uts.edu.au](http://online.uts.edu.au/)) under corresponding titles.
4. Hard copy text books which cover essentially the same contents (but without animations and other activities) as the online curriculum may be purchased at the Co-op Bookshop or any other places.
