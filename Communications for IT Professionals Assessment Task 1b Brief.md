**Assessment aim:** To create an effective team design solution, it is essential that each team member is familiar with the social, environmental, economic and cultural context of the community for which your team will create a design solution. This **INDIVIDUAL** **ASSESSMENT TASK** will allow you to develop your research skills and information literacy (finding, evaluating and referencing information), and acquire knowledge relevant to the team project. 

**Weight:** 20%

**Length:** 750 words. 10% tolerance on the word count is permitted. The word count does not include your reference list (but it does include your in-text references).

**Assessment requirements:** This is an individual assessment task that builds your skills in finding, evaluating and referencing information sources. You will investigate and evaluate information to become familiar with the context of the future team project, critically evaluating the information and sources to synthesis your research into a written summary.

You will write a summary of the research that you have conducted so far, focusing **on one key question relevant to** **your chosen Design Area for each member of your group**. Ensure that information sources found and used are reliable and relevant, and are referenced correctly in your summary. You should decide on which of these questions to concentrate, once design groups have been formed in the Week 2 tutorial. This individual assessment task will contribute background research to the group project.

**Assessment tip:** Delegate different research focus to each team member, This can later be combined to form a more comprehensive background research summary that can be used in your report (task 2).  **Note that only the delegation of research topics can be done in the team, you must do your own INDIVIDUAL research and writing for this assessment.**

**Sources**

**You should have at least 2 references excluding EWB and TSIRC references.** 

**You should also reference EWB and TSIRC where appropriate, referencing at least 3 resources they have provided.** 

If you are including a source that was downloaded from or linked to EWB or partner websites or Canvas, it may not be clear in your reference. In this case, you can include [Sourced from EWB/Partner/Canvas] at the end of your reference in the Reference list to highlight this as a source counting towards the EWB/Partner/Canvas minimum.

### Example

Below are two exemplars of Assessment Task 1 from a previous challenge in Far North Queensland. Note that this is a guide ONLY. The examples are also shorter than the 750 words you need to produce. Notice that the background research focuses on the environmental background specific to the Design Project Topic of turtle conservation in the first example and tourism in the second. It also includes information that is general to Far North Queensland and specific to the Design Project Topic, as relevant.

**As an appendix to your submission**, you need to include a screenshot of the first page of each of your references. The screenshots must show:

- enough detail to identify them (e.g., the title and authors), AND
- show at least the abstract for journals and conference papers, the page you are citing if the source is a book, or some of the content for websites and other sources.

If you cannot get all of the required information into one screenshot you may provide more than one screenshot. Do not upload copies of the full papers as this will raise your similarity score in Turnitin. **If a reference does not have correct screenshot(s) in the appendix, it will not count towards your number of references.**
