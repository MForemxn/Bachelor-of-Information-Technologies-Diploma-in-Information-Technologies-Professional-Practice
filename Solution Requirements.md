## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Solution requirements specify the technical and functional criteria a solution must meet to address business and stakeholder needs effectively.

## OVERVIEW:
Solution requirements are detailed specifications that outline the technical and functional aspects a solution must fulfill to meet business and stakeholder needs. These requirements are crucial for guiding the development and [[implementation]] of a solution, ensuring it is fit for purpose. They include functional requirements, which describe what the solution should do, and non-functional requirements, which detail how the solution should perform. By clearly defining solution requirements, project teams can ensure that the final product meets the necessary standards and performs as expected. This [[process]] helps in minimizing risks, managing project scope, and ensuring that the solution aligns with both business objectives and stakeholder expectations. Properly documented solution requirements also facilitate better communication among team members, streamline development [[processes]], and provide a basis for testing and validation.
