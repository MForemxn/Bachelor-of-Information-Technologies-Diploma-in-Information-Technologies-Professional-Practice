## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Risk treatment in [[cybersecurity]] involves selecting and implementing measures to mitigate, transfer, accept, or avoid identified risks to protect [[information systems]].

## OVERVIEW:
Risk treatment is a crucial phase in the [[cybersecurity]] [[risk management]] [[Process]], focusing on selecting and implementing appropriate measures to address identified risks. This [[Process]] involves four primary strategies: [[risk mitigation]], risk transfer, risk acceptance, and risk avoidance. [[Risk mitigation]] aims to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk through controls and safeguards. Risk transfer involves shifting the risk to a third party, such as through insurance or outsourcing. Risk acceptance is the [[decision]] to accept the risk without additional measures, often because the cost of mitigation exceeds the potential impact. Risk avoidance involves altering plans or [[processes]] to eliminate the risk entirely. Effective risk treatment requires a thorough understanding of the organisation's risk appetite, resources, and strategic objectives. By implementing the chosen risk treatment strategies, organisations can enhance their [[cybersecurity]] posture, protect critical assets, and ensure business continuity. This proactive approach is essential for managing the dynamic and evolving landscape of cyber threats.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Risk treatment addresses identified [[cybersecurity]] risks.
2. Involves mitigation, transfer, acceptance, and avoidance strategies.
3. Mitigation reduces risk likelihood or impact.
4. Transfer shifts risk to third parties.
5. Acceptance involves tolerating the risk.
6. Avoidance eliminates the risk entirely.
7. Requires understanding of risk appetite and resources.
8. Enhances [[cybersecurity]] posture and asset protection.
9. Ensures business continuity.
10. Manages dynamic and evolving cyber threats.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Effective risk treatment involves multiple strategies.
2. Mitigation and transfer reduce risk exposure.
3. Acceptance and avoidance depend on risk assessment.
4. Understanding risk appetite guides treatment decisions.
5. Proactive risk treatment ensures robust [[cybersecurity]] and continuity.
