## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
SQL enables [[data]] retrieval, manipulation, and analysis through simple queries, aggregate functions, [[data]] modification statements, joins, and subqueries.

## OVERVIEW:
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for managing and manipulating relational databases. Simple queries allow users to retrieve specific [[data]] from one or more tables using the SELECT statement, often combined with WHERE clauses to filter results. Aggregate functions, such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, and MIN, perform calculations on a set of values to return a single value, aiding in [[data analysis]]. [[Data]] modification statements, including INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, enable users to add, modify, or remove [[data]] within tables. Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns, with simple joins (INNER JOIN) returning matching records and complex joins (LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN) handling various matching scenarios. Subqueries, or nested queries, allow for more complex [[data]] retrieval by embedding one query within another. Together, these SQL features provide robust capabilities for [[data]] management and analysis.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Simple queries retrieve specific [[data]] using SELECT and WHERE.
2. Aggregate functions perform calculations on [[data]] sets.
3. Common aggregate functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN.
4. [[Data]] modification statements: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
5. Simple joins (INNER JOIN) combine matching rows from tables.
6. Complex joins: LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN.
7. Subqueries embed one query within another for complex retrieval.
8. SQL enables comprehensive [[data]] management and analysis.
9. Joins handle various [[data]] matching scenarios.
10. Aggregate functions aid in summarising [[data]].

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. SQL retrieves and filters [[data]] with simple queries.
2. Aggregate functions summarise [[data]] sets for analysis.
3. [[Data]] modification statements manage table [[data]].
4. Joins combine [[data]] from multiple tables.
5. Subqueries enable complex [[data]] retrieval and manipulation.
