# What is Systems Design?
- systems design is a process that involves creating the architecture of a system to meet specific requirements
- it encompasses:
	- defining the components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements
	- involves both hardware and software design aspects
- aims to ensure that the system will be efficient, reliable, and maintainable

# Key Phases in Systems Design
- preliminary design
	- outlines the overall system architecture and identifies major components
- detailed design
	- delves into the specifics of each component, including algorithms, data structures, and communication protocols

# Importance of Systems Design
- critical for ensuring the system's functionality aligns with user needs and business goals
- impacts the system's future scalability, performance, and ease of maintenance
- influences the overall development cost and project timeline

# Systems Design Considerations
- user requirements
	- understanding what users need from the system is fundamental
- scalability and flexibility
	- designing systems that can grow and adapt over time
- [[security]]
	- incorporating [[security]] measures at the design stage to protect data and operations
- performance
	- ensuring the system can handle expected loads and perform tasks within acceptable time frames
- interoperability
	- ensuring the system can work with other systems or components

# Systems Design Methodologies
- structured design
	- focuses on breaking down the system into smaller parts and then integrating them
- object-oriented design (OOD)
	- based on the concept of "objects", which are data structures encapsulating data fields and methods
- service-oriented architecture (SOA)
	- designs the system as a set of interconnected services to enhance flexibility and reuse

# Tools and Techniques in Systems Design
- Unified Modeling Language (UML)
	- a standard way to visualize the design of a system
- flowcharts and data flow diagrams (DFDs)
	- graphical tools to represent the flow of data through the system
- prototyping
	- creating a preliminary version of the system for evaluation and feedback

# Challenges in Systems Design
- balancing competing priorities, such as cost, time, and quality
- predicting future requirements and technology trends
- ensuring the system design is aligned with the overall business strategy
- managing complexity, especially in large and distributed systems

# Best Practices in Systems Design
- involving stakeholders in the [[design process]] to gather diverse perspectives
- keeping the design modular to facilitate changes and maintenance
- documenting the design thoroughly for future reference and knowledge transfer
- conducting design reviews to identify and address potential issues early

# The Role of Design Patterns
- design patterns are standard solutions to common problems in software design
- they provide a template for solving similar problems, improving the efficiency of the [[design process]]
- examples include the Singleton pattern, Observer pattern, and Factory pattern

# Systems Design and Project Success
- a well-thought-out system design is foundational to project success
- influences the ease of [[implementation]], testing, and future enhancements
- requires a collaborative effort from the project team, stakeholders, and end-users to ensure the design meets all requirements and expectations
