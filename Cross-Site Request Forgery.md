# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
[[Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]] is a [[web security]] vulnerability that tricks a user into performing actions they did not intend to perform.

# OVERVIEW:
[[Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]] is a type of malicious exploit where an attacker tricks a user into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they are authenticated. This attack leverages the trust that a web application has in the user's browser, exploiting the fact that browsers automatically include credentials with requests. CSRF attacks can lead to unauthorized actions such as changing account details, making transactions, or altering application settings. To protect against CSRF, developers can implement anti-CSRF tokens, ensure proper validation of requests, and use same-site cookies. Understanding CSRF is essential for developers and users to safeguard web applications and maintain data integrity.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. CSRF tricks users into performing unintended actions.
2. Exploits trust between web applications and browsers.
3. Can lead to unauthorized transactions or data changes.
4. Anti-CSRF tokens help prevent these attacks.
5. Same-site cookies enhance security against CSRF.
6. Proper request validation is crucial for protection.
7. CSRF exploits authenticated user sessions.
8. Attackers leverage automatic credential inclusion.
9. User awareness is key to preventing CSRF.
10. Developers must implement robust security measures.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. CSRF is a significant web security threat.
2. Anti-CSRF tokens are essential for protection.
3. Understanding browser trust exploitation is crucial.
4. Developers must ensure proper request validation.
5. User education can help mitigate CSRF risks.
