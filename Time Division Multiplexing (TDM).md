## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) is a technique that divides time into slots, allowing multiple signals to share the same communication channel sequentially.

## OVERVIEW:
Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) is a method used in telecommunications to transmit multiple signals over a single communication channel by dividing time into distinct slots. Each signal is assigned a specific time slot during which it can transmit its [[data]]. This sequential sharing of the channel ensures that multiple signals can coexist without interference. TDM is commonly used in digital telephony and [[data]] communication systems, where it helps to optimise the use of available bandwidth. The effectiveness of TDM relies on precise timing and synchronisation to ensure that each signal transmits its [[data]] in the correct time slot without overlap. TDM can be implemented in both synchronous and asynchronous forms, depending on the application requirements.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. TDM divides time into slots.
2. Multiple signals share the same channel sequentially.
3. Each signal has a specific time slot.
4. Prevents interference between signals.
5. Used in digital telephony.
6. Applied in [[data]] communication systems.
7. Optimises bandwidth utilisation.
8. Requires precise timing and synchronisation.
9. Ensures no overlap of signals.
10. Can be synchronous or asynchronous.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. TDM allows sequential sharing of a communication channel.
2. Time slots prevent signal interference.
3. Widely used in telephony and [[data]] communications.
4. Optimises the efficiency of available bandwidth.
5. Precise timing is crucial for TDM's effectiveness.
