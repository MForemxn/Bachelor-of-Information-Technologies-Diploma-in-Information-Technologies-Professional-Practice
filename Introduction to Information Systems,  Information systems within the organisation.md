# What are [[Information Systems]]?
- an integrated set of components that collect, process, store, analyse, and disseminate information for a specific purpose
- **Purpose:** getting the right information to the right people at the right time
	- Purpose of [[Information Systems]] - getting the right information to the right people, at the right time, in the right amount, and in the right format.
# Components of [[Information Systems]]
- people, information technology, and procedures
	- automation moves work from humans side to the computer side. 
	- the layers are, from highest level to lowest:
		- [[Concepts of Information Systems - People|people]]
		- [[Concepts of Information Systems - Procedures|procedures]]
		- [[Concepts of Information Systems - Data|data]]
		- [[Concepts of Information Systems - Software|software]]
		- [[Concepts of Information Systems - Hardware|hardware]]
•People are those individuals who use the hardware and software, interface with it, or utilize its output.
# The business problem
- software has been developed and distributed globally
- software is disrupting every industry, and every organisation must make adjustments to their workflow to accomodate these changes. 
	- this can include shopping and commerce moving from brick and mortar stores to online retailers
	- music and video distribution moving to streaming services
	- payroll and HR responsibilities moving to software as a service, such as salesforce
	- photo distribution moving from physically printed photos to instagram and facebook for online sharing
- this means that major businesses and industries are being run by and relying on software
## [[Concepts of Information Systems - Software]] as a service
- the concept of delivering applications over the internet, as a service
- local software moving to web based systems
	- removes need for widespread maintenance 
	- free from complexity, for both users and devs
		- for example, google apps, dropbox, etc.
# [[Processes]] for Generating Information
- Three activities for producing the information:
	- Input: Capturing raw [[data]] or information
	- Processing : Converting input into a meaningful form
	- Output : Transferring the processed information to the  people who will use it or to the activities for which it will  be used
	- Example: a hotel reservation information system:
		
|Input|Process|Output|
|---|---|---|
|Customer’s name, Customer’s address, Credit card number, Number of rooms booked, Check-in date, Check out date|Classifying, Arranging, Calculating|Booking confirmation, Receipts for orders, Reports on online booking orders, The number of rooms booked  each year, Frequent customers
# How Does IT Impact Organisations
- allows people to make more informed decisions
	- allows people to have all the necessary information on hand to make the best decisions
		- does this through [[business analytics]] tools for example
		- ![[Pasted image 20240226210006.png]]
	- Example: role of IT in the health care system
		- Faster diagnosis and better [[decision]] making
		- long distance patient/clinician contact and care, advice, reminders, education, monitoring and remote admissions
		- Distance-learning- Behaviour change to prevent disease
		- Patient/patient interactions
			- Improving wellbeing of elderly/ patients
		- Researching & developing new medication
# Impact of IT on Employees Health
- often, IT advancements negatively impact the health of the employees who use it through interconnectedness.
	- some workers may feel overwhelmed by the tracking of their performance metrics by their managers 
	- also, a higher workload and a less clear boundary of work and non-work time contributes to a poor mental health from employees.
# Transaction Processing Systems
- A transaction is any event which generates [[data]] worthy of being captures
	- this means that transaction processing systems support the:
		- monitoring, collection, storage, and processing of [[data]] from an organisations basic business transactions
- TPS collects [[data]] continuously, usually in real time
	- ![[Pasted image 20240226211136.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20240226211147.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20240226211154.png]]
## Complexities of transactional [[data]]
- transactional [[data]] often involve more than one computer
	- the links between these computers often create a weak point for TPS systems
	- any component failure at any time could cause a catastrophic failure
		- •E.g an error at some point in an ATM withdrawal can enable a customer to receive cash, although the bank’s computer indicates that he or she did not.
	- transactional [[data]] can be processed online in real time or in batch.
		- batch: transactions are accumulated over a period of time and are processed as a group
		- online real time: each transaction is processed immediately and changes are reflected across all systems almost instantly.

# [[Decision Support Systems]]
- DSS allows middle managers to analyse a large amount of raw [[data]] to support their [[decision]] making. 
	- this allows them to analyse complex environments between (sometimes) millions of raw [[data]] points with ease
# Executive Support Systems
- ESS allow higher, more senior managers to make large scale, strategic decisions.
	- this may include "what products should we make in 5 years?"
- also allows for non-routine [[decision]] making
- allows the macro tracking and analysing of KPI's and other metrics
# Reporting Options
- there are 3 types of reports which all [[information systems]] are able to produce
	- routine reports: anything from hourly to yearly reports on all types of key [[data]] points
	- ad-hoc (on demand) reports: [[Drill Down Reports|drill-down]], [[Key-Indicator Reports|key indicator]], and [[Comparative Reporting|comparative reports]]
	- [[Exception Reports|exception reports]]: all information which falls outside a certain threshold (outliers)
# Expert Systems
- designed to do the most advanced and reliable problem solving problems.
- capabilities:
	- aiding in [[decision]] making
	- [[data analysis]] 
	- interpreting input
	- justifying conclusions
- characteristics
	- highly effective
	- understandable
	- reliable
	- able to process [[data]] quickly
	- capable of critical [[decision]] making
- three key people are needed for expert systems development
	- Domain expert: person or group with the expertise or knowledge the expert system is trying to capture
	- Knowledge engineer: person who has training or experience in the design, development, implementation, and maintenance of an expert system
	- Knowledge user: person or group who uses and benefits from the expert system
		- Needs no previous training or experience
# Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems
- functional area [[information systems]] were developed independently of one another, 
- ERP systems are designed to correct a lack of communication among the functional area IS!
- ERP systems tightly integrate the functional area IS via a common [[database]].
- The leading ERP software vendor is SAP!

|Benefits|Limitations|
|---|---|
|Organizational flexibility and agility|Companies may need to change their existing business [[processes]]|
|Facilitating [[decision]] making|ERP systems can be complex, expensive|
|Improving quality and efficiency|time-consuming to implement|
