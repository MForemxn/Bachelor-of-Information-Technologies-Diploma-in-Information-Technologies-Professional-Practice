# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The ANDing [[process]] involves performing a bitwise logical AND operation between an [[IP address]] and a [[subnet mask]] to determine the network address.

# OVERVIEW:
The ANDing [[process]] is a fundamental operation in networking used to calculate the network address from an [[IP address]] and a [[subnet mask]]. This [[process]] involves a bitwise logical AND operation, where each bit of the [[IP address]] is compared with the corresponding bit of the [[subnet mask]]. If both bits are 1, the result is 1; otherwise, the result is 0. The outcome of this operation is the network address, which identifies the specific network segment to which the [[IP address]] belongs. This is crucial for [[routing]], as it helps determine the path [[data]] packets should take to reach their destination. The ANDing [[process]] is essential for network configuration, enabling efficient [[IP address]] management and ensuring that devices can communicate within the correct network boundaries.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. ANDing calculates the network address from an IP and [[subnet mask]].
2. Involves a bitwise logical AND operation.
3. Compares each bit of the [[IP address]] and [[subnet mask]].
4. Resulting network address identifies the network segment.
5. Crucial for [[routing]] and [[data]] packet path determination.
6. Ensures devices communicate within correct network boundaries.
7. Essential for efficient [[IP address]] management.
8. Supports accurate network configuration.
9. Helps in understanding network and host portions of an address.
10. Fundamental for network design and troubleshooting.
