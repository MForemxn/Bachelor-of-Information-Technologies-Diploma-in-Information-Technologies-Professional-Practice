# What are data cascades?
- data cascades refer to the compounding errors that occur in a data science project lifecycle
- these errors often stem from:
	- poor data quality
	- inadequate data understanding
	- misalignment between the data collected and the project objectives
- data cascades can significantly impact the outcome of a project, leading to:
	- inaccurate analyses
	- flawed [[decision]]-making
	- increased costs
	- delays in project timelines

# Causes of data cascades
- several factors contribute to the occurrence of data cascades, including:
	- lack of collaboration among team members
	- insufficient data governance policies
	- inadequate data preparation and cleaning [[processes]]
	- failure to properly validate and test data [[models]]
- these issues can arise at any stage of the data project, from initial data collection to the final analysis phase

# Impact of data cascades
- the consequences of data cascades can be far-reaching, affecting not just the immediate project but also:
	- the reputation of the data science team or organisation
	- the trust in data-driven [[decision]]-making [[processes]]
	- the overall efficiency and effectiveness of data initiatives
- in severe cases, data cascades can lead to the complete failure of a project

# Strategies to mitigate data cascades
- to prevent or minimise the impact of data cascades, organisations can adopt several strategies:
	- fostering a culture of collaboration and open communication among team members
	- implementing robust data governance and quality control measures
	- investing in training and resources to improve data literacy and skills
	- conducting thorough data validation and testing throughout the project lifecycle
- these strategies can [[help]] ensure that data projects are built on a solid foundation of high-quality, relevant data

# The role of data governance in preventing data cascades
- data governance plays a crucial role in mitigating the risk of data cascades by:
	- establishing clear policies and procedures for data management
	- defining roles and responsibilities for data stewardship
	- ensuring data quality and [[integrity]] through regular audits and assessments
- effective data governance can [[help]] create a structured environment where data cascades are less likely to occur
