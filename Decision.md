# What is a Decision?
- a decision refers to a choice among two or more alternatives that individuals and groups make.
# Decision Making Phases
- there are three major decision making phases
	- intelligence
		- managers examine a situation and identify and define the problem or opportunity
	- design
		- decision makers construct a model for the situation. they do this by making assumptions that simplify reality and by expressing the relationships among all the relevant variables. managers then validate the model by using test [[data]].
	- choice
		- involves selecting a solution or course of action that seems best suited to resolve the problem.

# Problem Structure
- Structured: deal with routine and repetitive problems for which standard solutions exist.
- Unstructured Decisions: there is no standardised procedure for carrying out any of these three phases
- Semi-Structured: located between structured and unstructured decisions, in which only some of the decision process phases are structured. 
# Nature of Decisions
- Strategic planning: the long range goals and policies for growth and resource allocation
- Management control: acquiring and using resources efficiently in accomplishing organisational goals.
- Operational Control: executing specific tasks efficiently and effectively
