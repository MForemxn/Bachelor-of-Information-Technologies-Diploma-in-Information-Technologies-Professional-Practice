# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:  
[[GUI]] controls in [[Swift]] are interactive elements that enable user interaction with applications, facilitating [[input]], navigation, and [[feedback]] through a graphical [[interface]].

# OVERVIEW:  
[[Graphical User Interface]] ([[GUI]]) controls in [[Swift]] are essential components for building interactive applications, allowing users to engage with software through visual elements. These controls include buttons, sliders, text fields, switches, and more, each serving specific functions to facilitate user [[input]], navigation, and [[feedback]]. [[Swift]], particularly through frameworks like UIKit for [[iOS]] and AppKit for macOS, provides a comprehensive set of [[GUI]] controls that developers can customise and integrate into their applications. These controls are designed to be intuitive and responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience. By leveraging [[Swift]]'s modern [[syntax]] and capabilities, developers can create dynamic and visually appealing interfaces that enhance user engagement and application functionality.
