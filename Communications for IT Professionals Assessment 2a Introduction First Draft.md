# First Draft
In the context of the escalating waste management challenges on Saibai Island, this proposal seeks to address the pressing issue of waste accumulation and its detrimental environmental impact. Recognising the urgent need for sustainable waste management practices, our initiative aims to reframe waste as a valuable resource rather than mere refuse destined for landfill sites. This document outlines a design area focused on "Waste as a Resource," with the objective of diverting waste from landfills through innovative and practical solutions. The core of our proposal revolves around the pivotal question: Relating to the overwhelming amount of waste on Saibai Island, how can we identify alternative waste destinations in order to save the environment from landfill waste pollution?

The opportunity identified within this design project centers on the transformation of waste management practices on Saibai Island. By exploring and implementing alternative waste destinations, we endeavour not only to mitigate the environmental pollution associated with landfill waste but also to unveil the potential of waste as a catalyst for economic enrichment and community development. The essence of our approach is encapsulated in the "How might we...?" statement, serving as the guiding principle for our design solution exploration.

Our commitment to addressing the waste management issue on Saibai Island encompasses a comprehensive evaluation of the current waste practices, identification of viable waste diversion strategies, and the promotion of waste as a valuable resource for the community. We aim to do the following;
- Propose innovative solutions that go beyond traditional waste disposal methods, focusing on waste reduction, reuse, and recycling as principal components of waste management.
- Explore the economic potential of waste by identifying avenues through which waste can contribute to the local economy, such as material recovery, composting for agricultural use, and the development of waste-to-energy projects.
- Engage with local communities, stakeholders, and experts in environmental management to foster a collaborative approach towards sustainable waste practices.

However, it is crucial to delineate the boundaries of our proposal. Our focus will primarily be on:
- The identification and [[implementation]] of practical and community-oriented waste management solutions.
- Initiatives that are feasible within the socio-economic and environmental context of Saibai Island.

We will not engage in:
- The development of highly technical or capital-intensive projects that are not sustainable or accessible for the Saibai Island community.
- Solutions that require significant alterations to the existing legal or cultural frameworks of the community without thorough consultation and consent.

This proposal, therefore, sets the stage for a transformative approach to waste management on Saibai Island, emphasising the valorisation of waste as a resource. Through this initiative, we aspire to not only alleviate the environmental burden of waste but also to unlock new opportunities for economic and community development.
