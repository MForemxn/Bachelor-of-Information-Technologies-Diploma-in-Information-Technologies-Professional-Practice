This subject is composed of formal lectures, video learning materials, practical programming exercises/projects, lab quizzes and a collaborative report.

The lectures will present new topics on iOS each week. Live code demonstrations will be provided in the lectures to enhance students' understanding of the topic. Students are encouraged to follow the demonstrations on their own computers whenever possible. Questioning by students is actively encouraged.

The video materials provide the detailed demonstration on how to use iOS development environment and focus on GUI programming. They will give student the opportunities to self study these topics prior to the lectures and the laboratory exercises.

The laboratories consist of small programming exercises that help student to get practical understanding of the software development concepts delivered in the lectures. The expected results from the exercises are provided so that students can check their progresses. There will be three small quizzes in the laboratories at various stages to check students' knowledge. This ensures students acquire necessary knowledge at a consistent pace. The last three laboratories will be dedicated to group collaboration work for Project 3. Laboratory assistants will be there to facilitate the sessions, answering questions, providing comment and encourage group collaboration.

The individual projects will present the students with the opportunity to practise the knowledge and the skills learned from the lectures and the laboratory exercises. The students will create small, useful, working programs independently. The projects will be assessed by both fellow students (peer assessment) and the laboratory assistants.

The group project ensures the students have the capabilities to collaboratively explore the vast amount of online iOS documentation and knowledge bases and apply the knowledge into practical usage. The project also encourages the students to learn from their peer group via peer assessment.
