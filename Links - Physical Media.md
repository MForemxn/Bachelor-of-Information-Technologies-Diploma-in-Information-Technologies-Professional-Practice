## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Physical media links refer to the tangible materials used to transmit [[data]] across networks, including cables and fibre optics.

## OVERVIEW:
Physical media links are the foundational components of network infrastructure, responsible for the actual transmission of [[data]] between devices. These links include various types of cables such as twisted pair, coaxial, and fibre optic cables. Twisted pair cables are commonly used in local area networks (LANs) due to their cost-effectiveness and ease of installation. Coaxial cables, known for their shielding and durability, are often used in television and internet connections. Fibre optic cables, which use light to transmit [[data]], offer high-speed and long-distance communication capabilities, making them ideal for backbone networks and high-performance applications. The choice of physical media depends on factors like distance, bandwidth requirements, and environmental conditions. Understanding the characteristics and applications of different physical media is crucial for designing efficient and reliable network systems.
