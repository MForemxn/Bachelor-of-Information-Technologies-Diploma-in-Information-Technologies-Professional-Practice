### [[Error Handling]] and Logging

[[Error handling]] and logging are crucial for identifying and responding to [[security]] incidents. Proper [[implementation]] helps in monitoring and diagnosing issues.

- Provides insights into potential [[security]] breaches.
- Helps in tracking and resolving errors efficiently.
- Ensures sensitive information is not exposed in logs.

### [[Security]] Testing

[[Security]] testing involves evaluating software for vulnerabilities and ensuring it meets [[security]] requirements. It includes various testing methods like [[penetration testing]] and vulnerability scanning.

- Identifies and mitigates [[security]] risks.
- Validates the effectiveness of [[security]] measures.
- Ensures compliance with [[security]] standards.

### Patch Management

Patch management is the [[process]] of applying updates to software to fix vulnerabilities and improve [[security]].

- Keeps software protected against known threats.
- Ensures timely application of [[security]] patches.
- Reduces the risk of exploitation by attackers.

# [[Security]] in the Development Lifecycle

[[Security]] in the development lifecycle involves integrating [[security]] practices into every phase of [[software development]], from requirements analysis to [[maintenance]].

## Requirements Analysis

Requirements analysis involves identifying [[security]] requirements and ensuring they are incorporated into the [[software design]].

- Defines [[security]] objectives and constraints.
- Ensures alignment with organisational [[security]] policies.
- Identifies potential [[security]] risks early.

## Design

The design phase involves creating a secure architecture that addresses identified [[security]] requirements and risks.

- Incorporates [[security]] principles into the architecture.
- Ensures [[scalability]] and [[flexibility]] for future [[security]] needs.
- Facilitates secure integration with other systems.

## [[Implementation]]

[[Implementation]] involves writing secure code and following best practices to prevent vulnerabilities.

- Adheres to secure coding standards.
- Utilises [[security]]-focused development tools.
- Ensures code is free from common vulnerabilities.

## Testing

Testing involves evaluating the software for [[security]] vulnerabilities and ensuring it meets [[security]] requirements.

- Conducts thorough [[security]] testing and assessments.
- Validates the effectiveness of [[security]] controls.
- Identifies and mitigates potential [[security]] issues.

## [[Maintenance]]/Evolution

[[Maintenance]] involves updating and improving software to address new [[security]] threats and vulnerabilities.

- Adapts to evolving [[security]] challenges.
- Maintains compliance with [[security]] standards.
# What Makes Software Secure?
# What Makes Software Secure?

Secure software is designed to protect against threats and vulnerabilities, ensuring reliability and trustworthiness. It incorporates various [[security]] measures to resist, tolerate, and recover from attacks, providing a robust defence against potential threats.

1. [[Security]] measures must be integrated into the [[software design]].
2. Attack resistance is crucial for preventing unauthorised access.
3. Tolerance ensures software continues to [[function]] under attack.
4. Resilience allows for quick recovery from [[security]] incidents.
5. [[Secure coding practices]] are essential for preventing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Resistance

Attack resistance refers to the software's ability to withstand and prevent unauthorised access or attacks. It involves implementing strong [[security]] measures to protect against potential threats.

- Utilises strong [[authentication]] and access controls.
- Employs [[encryption]] to safeguard sensitive [[data]].
- Implements robust defence mechanisms against common attacks.

## Tolerance

Tolerance is the software's ability to maintain functionality and performance even when under attack. It ensures that critical operations continue without disruption.

- Incorporates redundancy and failover mechanisms.
- Ensures critical functions remain operational.
- Minimises the impact of [[security]] incidents on users.

## Resilience

Resilience is the software's ability to recover quickly from attacks and restore normal operations. It involves implementing effective incident response and recovery strategies.

- Implements effective incident response plans.
- Ensures rapid recovery from [[security]] breaches.
- Maintains [[data]] [[integrity]] and [[availability]] post-attack.

# Secure Coding Practice

[[Secure coding practices]] are essential for developing software that is free from vulnerabilities and resistant to attacks. These practices involve following established guidelines and using [[security]]-focused tools to ensure code [[security]].

## Principle of Least Privilege

The principle of least privilege involves granting users and systems the minimum level of access necessary to perform their functions. This reduces the risk of accidental or malicious misuse of privileges.

- Limits access to sensitive [[data]] and functions.
- Reduces the attack surface by minimising permissions.
- Encourages regular [[review]] and adjustment of access rights.

## Validation of Inputs

Validation of inputs is a critical [[security]] practice that involves ensuring all user inputs are checked for correctness and safety before processing. This prevents malicious [[data]] from causing harm.

- Ensures [[data integrity]] and [[security]].
- Validates [[input]] against expected formats and values.

# New Era of [[AI]] [[Implementation]] Tools

The new era of [[AI]] [[implementation]] tools brings advanced capabilities to [[software development]], enhancing efficiency and innovation. However, it also introduces new [[security]] challenges, particularly regarding dependency on external suggestions.

## Dependency on External Suggestions

Dependency on external suggestions refers to the reliance on [[AI]]-generated recommendations and code snippets during development. While these can enhance productivity, they also pose [[security]] risks if not properly vetted.

- Requires careful evaluation of [[AI]]-generated code.
- Ensures compliance with [[security]] standards and practices.
- Encourages developers to verify the [[security]] of external suggestions.
