# What is BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)?
- BSD, short for Berkeley Software Distribution, is a [[Unix operating system]] derivative developed and distributed by the University of California, Berkeley.
- it started as a collection of patches and add-ons to the original [[Unix operating system]].
- over time, BSD has evolved into a complete operating system in its own right.
# Evolution of BSD
- the journey of BSD began in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
	- initially, it was just additions to AT&T's Unix.
- notable releases include:
	- 1BSD, 2BSD, 2.5BSD, leading up to 4.4BSD, which was one of the last releases from Berkeley.
- after legal battles with AT&T, the focus shifted towards free, open-source distributions.
# BSD Variants
- today, BSD is not just a single operating system but a family of systems, each with its own focus and applications.
	- FreeBSD: known for its performance and advanced networking features.
	- NetBSD: emphasizes portability across a wide range of hardware platforms.
	- OpenBSD: focuses on security features, correctness, and proactive security measures.
	- DragonFly BSD: aims at high performance, particularly in multi-CPU environments.
# BSD Features
- BSD systems are known for their robustness, efficiency, and advanced networking capabilities.
	- includes a native filesystem (UFS, ZFS), advanced networking, and security features.
- they offer a comprehensive suite of standard Unix tools.
- BSD licenses are more permissive compared to other open-source licenses, allowing for wider use in both open and closed source projects.
# BSD in Modern Use
- BSD variants are widely used in servers, embedded systems, and networking equipment.
	- also popular among some desktop users who prefer a Unix-like environment.
- its influence is seen in many other operating systems, including macOS, which is built on a BSD-derived foundation.
# BSD Community and Development
- development is driven by a combination of volunteer and corporate contributions.
- each BSD variant has its own community and project structure.
	- communities are known for their dedication to code quality, documentation, and user support.
- BSD operating systems are often developed openly, with source code available for review and contribution.
