# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
[[Routing]] Information Protocol (RIP) is a distance-vector [[routing]] protocol used to determine the best path for [[data]] in a network.

# OVERVIEW:
[[Routing]] Information Protocol (RIP) is one of the oldest distance-vector [[routing]] protocols designed for use in small to medium-sized networks. It operates by using hop count as a [[routing]] metric, with a maximum allowable hop count of 15, which limits its use in larger networks. RIP routers periodically broadcast their entire [[routing]] table to neighboring routers, allowing them to update their own tables and determine the shortest path to each destination. This simplicity makes RIP easy to configure and manage, but it also leads to slower convergence times and potential [[routing]] loops. RIP has evolved through several versions, with RIP version 2 (RIPv2) introducing enhancements such as support for [[subnet]] masks and multicast [[routing]] updates. Despite its limitations, RIP remains a foundational protocol in networking education and is useful in scenarios where simplicity and ease of configuration are prioritized over [[scalability]] and speed.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. RIP is a distance-vector [[routing]] protocol.
2. Uses hop count as a [[routing]] metric.
3. Maximum hop count of 15 limits [[scalability]].
4. Periodically broadcasts entire [[routing]] table to neighbors.
5. Simple to configure and manage.
6. Slower convergence times compared to other protocols.
7. Potential for [[routing]] loops.
8. RIPv2 supports [[subnet]] masks and multicast updates.
9. Suitable for small to medium-sized networks.
10. Foundational protocol in networking education.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. RIP is easy to configure but limited in [[scalability]].
2. Uses hop count, with a maximum of 15, as its metric.
3. RIPv2 offers enhancements like [[subnet]] mask support.
4. Best for small networks prioritizing simplicity.
5. Important for understanding basic [[routing]] concepts
