# Managers and [[Decision]] Making
- management is a process where an organisation achieves its goals by means of proper resource allocation
- all managers perform the following roles
	- [[Interpersonal Roles]]: figurehead, leader, liaison
	- [[Informational Roles]]: monitor disseminator, spokesperson, analyser
	- [[Decisional Roles]]: entrepreneur disturbance handler, resource allocator, negotiator 
> IT can provide support to these roles
# Why do Managers need [[IT Support]]?
> Making good decisions is very difficult without solid information. 
- [[Decision]] making is difficult due to the following trends:
	- The number of alternatives is constantly increasing, due to innovations in technology, improved communications, the development of global markets, and the use of [[the Internet]] and e-business.
	- Most decisions must be made under time pressure. It often is not possible to manually process information fast enough to be effective.
	- It often is necessary to rapidly access remote information, consult with experts, or conduct a group [[decision]]-making session, all without incurring large expenses.
# What is [[Business Intelligence]]
> The aim of BI is to support and improve [[decision]]-making within an organisation.

# [[Business Intelligence]] Applications for [[Data Analysis]]
- there are a variety of applications for [[data analysis]]. these include:
	- [[multidimensional arrays or online analytical processing (OLAP)]]
		- involves slicing and dicing data stored in a dimensional format, drilling down in the data to greater detail, and aggregating the data.
	- data mining
		- refers to the process of searching for valuable business information in a large [[database]]
			- used for identifying and predicting patterns and behaviours
		- helps to explain why something happens, and predicts what will happen in the future
	- [[Decision Support Systems]]
		- allows for the information relevant to making macro business decisions to be visible and accessible to higher managers. 
# Era of the [[API]]
- stands for application programming interface
- works as a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
