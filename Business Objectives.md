## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Business objectives are specific, measurable actions that organisations undertake to achieve their broader [[business goals]] and strategic aims.

## OVERVIEW:
Business objectives are precise, actionable steps that organisations set to achieve their broader [[business goals]]. Unlike goals, which are broad and long-term, objectives are specific, short-term targets that are measurable and time-bound. They provide a clear roadmap for what needs to be accomplished, by whom, and within what timeframe. Business objectives [[help]] in breaking down larger goals into manageable tasks, making it easier to track progress and make adjustments as needed. They are essential for operational planning, resource allocation, and performance evaluation. Effective business objectives are aligned with the organisation's overall strategy and are designed to be achievable and relevant to the business context. By setting clear objectives, organisations can ensure that all efforts are focused and coordinated towards achieving their strategic goals, thereby enhancing efficiency and effectiveness.
