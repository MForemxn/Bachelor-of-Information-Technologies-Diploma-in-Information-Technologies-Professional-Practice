# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
[[DNS]] attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the Domain Name System to redirect users, intercept [[data]], or disrupt services, compromising internet [[security]].

# OVERVIEW:
[[DNS]] attacks target the Domain Name System ([[DNS]]), which is crucial for translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. These attacks can take various forms, including [[DNS]] spoofing (or cache poisoning), where attackers insert false information into a [[DNS]] resolver's cache, redirecting users to malicious sites. Another common attack is [[DNS]] amplification, a type of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that overwhelms a target with traffic by exploiting the [[DNS]] protocol's ability to generate large responses from small queries. [[DNS]] tunneling involves encoding [[data]] within [[DNS]] queries and responses to bypass network [[security]] measures. Attackers may also use [[DNS]] hijacking to redirect traffic from legitimate sites to fraudulent ones by altering [[DNS]] records. These attacks can lead to [[data]] theft, service disruption, and loss of user trust. Protecting against [[DNS]] attacks involves implementing [[security]] measures such as [[DNSSEC]], regular monitoring, and using secure [[DNS]] resolvers.
