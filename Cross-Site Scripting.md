# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
[[Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)]] is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

# OVERVIEW:
[[Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)]] is a common web security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into content from otherwise trusted websites. These scripts are executed in the user's browser, allowing attackers to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, and even perform actions on behalf of the user. XSS can be classified into three main types: stored, reflected, and DOM-based. Stored XSS involves injecting scripts that are permanently stored on the target server, while reflected XSS involves scripts that are reflected off a web server, and DOM-based XSS occurs when the vulnerability exists in the client-side code. To prevent XSS, developers should validate and sanitize user inputs, use secure coding practices, and implement Content Security Policies (CSP).

# MAIN POINTS:
1. XSS allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages.
2. It can lead to data theft and unauthorized actions.
3. Three main types: stored, reflected, and DOM-based XSS.
4. Stored XSS involves scripts stored on the server.
5. Reflected XSS involves scripts reflected off a server.
6. DOM-based XSS occurs in client-side code.
7. Input validation and sanitization are crucial for prevention.
8. Content Security Policies (CSP) help mitigate XSS risks.
9. Secure coding practices are essential for developers.
10. User data can be compromised through XSS attacks.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. XSS is a prevalent web security vulnerability.
2. Understanding different XSS types is crucial for prevention.
3. Input validation and sanitization are key defences.
4. Implementing CSP enhances security against XSS.
5. Developers must adopt secure coding practices.
