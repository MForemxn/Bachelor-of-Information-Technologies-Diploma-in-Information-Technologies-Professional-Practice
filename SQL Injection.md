SQL Injection is a prevalent [[security]] vulnerability that occurs in the database layer of an application. It allows attackers to execute malicious SQL code on a database server behind a web application. Attackers exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities by manipulating standard SQL queries to achieve unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to retrieve, manipulate, or delete [[data]]. This vulnerability exploits weaknesses in input validation and parameterization.

## How SQL Injection Works

- **Injection Mechanism**: Attackers insert (or "inject") malicious SQL statements into input fields or through manipulated HTTP requests. When these inputs are processed by the server without proper sanitization or parameterization, the malicious SQL code is executed.
- **Example**: Consider a simple login form with fields for a username and password. An attacker might enter a username input like `admin' --` where the `--` denotes a SQL comment, potentially bypassing [[authentication]] by commenting out the rest of the SQL query.

## Types of SQL Injection

- **In-band SQLi**: The attacker uses the same communication channel to launch the attack and gather results. It can be further categorized into Error-based SQLi and Union-based SQLi.
- **Inferential (Blind) SQLi**: The attacker sends [[data]] payloads and observes the behavior of the server to infer its structure. Blind SQLi can be time-based or boolean-based.
- **Out-of-band SQLi**: [[Data]] is transmitted by the attacker through different channels, which is used when the attacker cannot use the same channel for sending the payload and receiving the information.

## Prevention Techniques

- **Prepared Statements with Parameterized Queries**: Use prepared statements and parameterized queries to ensure that SQL code execution treats user input as [[data]], not as part of the SQL command.
- **Stored Procedures**: Use stored procedures to encapsulate the SQL logic on the database server, reducing exposure to SQL injection, though still requiring careful implementation to avoid vulnerabilities.
- **Input Validation**: While not a complete defense, validating user inputs for type, length, format, and range can reduce the risk of SQL Injection.
- **ORMs (Object Relational Mapping Libraries)**: Utilise ORM libraries, which often include built-in protections against SQL Injection by abstracting database interactions.
- **Least Privilege**: Ensure that database accounts used by [[web applications]] have the minimum necessary permissions, reducing the potential impact of a successful injection attack.
- **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**: Deploy WAFs to help detect and block SQL Injection attempts and other common web application attacks.

## Impact of SQL Injection

The impact of a successful SQL Injection attack can be devastating, including:

- Unauthorized access to sensitive [[data]], such as personal information, financial details, and proprietary information.
- Database manipulation, allowing attackers to alter or delete [[data]].
- Escalation of privileges within the database server.
- Potentially gaining administrative access to the database system, allowing for the execution of arbitrary commands on the server.

SQL Injection remains one of the most critical web application vulnerabilities due to its potential for significant impact and the prevalence of susceptible applications. Awareness, proper [[security]] practices in application development, and regular [[security]] assessments are key to mitigating the risk of SQL Injection attacks.
