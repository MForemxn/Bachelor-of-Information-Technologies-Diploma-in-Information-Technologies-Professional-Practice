## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
System development processes, including traditional and agile methodologies, and requirements engineering processes are crucial for effective software development and project management.

## OVERVIEW:
System development processes encompass various methodologies used to design, develop, and maintain software systems. Traditional methodologies, such as the Waterfall model, follow a linear and sequential approach, emphasizing thorough documentation and upfront planning. Agile methodologies, on the other hand, prioritize flexibility, iterative development, and customer collaboration, allowing for rapid adjustments based on feedback. Requirements engineering processes involve the systematic [[identification]], documentation, and management of software requirements. This phase is critical as it ensures that the final product meets the needs and expectations of stakeholders. Effective requirements engineering includes activities such as elicitation, analysis, specification, validation, and management. Both traditional and agile methodologies incorporate requirements engineering, but they approach it differently. Traditional methods often involve detailed requirements documentation early in the project, while agile methods focus on continuous requirements gathering and refinement throughout the development cycle. Understanding these processes is essential for successful project execution, ensuring that software solutions are delivered on time, within budget, and meet quality standards.
