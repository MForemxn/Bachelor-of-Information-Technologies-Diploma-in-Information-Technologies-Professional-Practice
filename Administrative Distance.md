## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Administrative distance is a metric used to determine the trustworthiness of a [[routing]] source, influencing route selection in routers.

## OVERVIEW:
Administrative distance (AD) is a critical concept in networking that helps routers determine the most reliable route when multiple paths to a destination are available. It is a numerical value assigned to [[routing]] protocols, indicating the trustworthiness of the source of the [[routing]] information. Lower AD values are preferred over higher ones, meaning routes with lower administrative distances are considered more trustworthy and are selected over others. This mechanism is essential in environments where multiple [[routing]] protocols are in use, as it helps routers make informed decisions about which route to install in the [[routing]] table. For example, directly connected routes typically have the lowest AD, while external routes from other protocols have higher values. Understanding and configuring administrative distance is crucial for network administrators to ensure optimal [[routing]] and network performance.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Determines the trustworthiness of [[routing]] sources.
2. Influences route selection in routers.
3. Lower values indicate more trustworthy routes.
4. Essential in environments with multiple [[routing]] protocols.
5. Helps routers decide which route to install in the [[routing]] table.
6. Directly connected routes have the lowest AD.
7. External routes from other protocols have higher AD values.
8. Critical for optimal [[routing]] and network performance.
9. Configurable by network administrators for tailored [[routing]] decisions.
10. Ensures reliable and efficient network operations.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Administrative distance helps prioritize [[routing]] sources based on trustworthiness.
2. Lower AD values are preferred for route selection.
3. Crucial for environments with multiple [[routing]] protocols.
4. Configuring AD is key to optimal network performance.
5. Ensures efficient and reliable [[routing]] decisions.
