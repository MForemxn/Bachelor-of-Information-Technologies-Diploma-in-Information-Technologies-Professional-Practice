# [[Principles of network applications]]
Network applications rely on principles like client-server architecture, protocols, [[scalability]], [[security]], and reliability to facilitate communication and [[data]] exchange over networks.

# [[Web and HTTP]]
The web relies on the [[HTTP]] protocol to facilitate the exchange of information between clients and servers, enabling web browsing and [[data]] transfer.

# [[Email and DNS]]
Email relies on protocols like [[SMTP]], [[IMAP]], and POP3 for sending and receiving messages, while [[DNS]] translates domain names into IP addresses for network communication.

# [[Socket Programming - Creating Network Applications]]
Socket programming enables the creation of network applications by establishing communication channels between devices over a network using sockets.
