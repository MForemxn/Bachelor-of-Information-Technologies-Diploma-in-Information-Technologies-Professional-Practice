# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a framework of policies, technologies, and procedures for managing [[digital certificates]] and public-key [[encryption]].

# OVERVIEW:
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a comprehensive system designed to manage [[digital certificates]] and public-key [[encryption]], ensuring secure electronic communications and transactions. It consists of several components, including Certificate Authorities (CAs), Registration Authorities (RAs), [[digital certificates]], and public/private key pairs. PKI provides the framework for creating, distributing, managing, and revoking [[digital certificates]], which are used to authenticate identities and encrypt [[data]]. The infrastructure supports various [[security]] services such as [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], [[authentication]], and [[non-repudiation]]. PKI is essential for enabling secure communications over [[the internet]], including secure email, online banking, and e-commerce transactions. It ensures that sensitive information is protected from interception and tampering by providing a trusted environment for exchanging public [[keys]]. PKI also includes protocols and standards that facilitate interoperability between different systems and applications.
