Most models include two types of input variables:
- **﻿﻿Decision variables**: "What is our reorder point for these raw materials?
- ﻿﻿**Environmental variables**: (external to the organisation): "What will the rate of inflation be?"
- ﻿﻿The output in this example would be the total cost of raw materials.
- The point of a sensitivity analysis is usually to determine the impact of environmental variables on the result of the analysis.
- Companies generally perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of environmental variables analysis.
- ﻿﻿Sensitivity analysis is extremely valuable because it enables the system to adapt to changing conditions and to the varying requirements of different decision-making situations.
- ﻿﻿It provides a better understanding of the model as well as of the problem that the model purports to describe.
> For example, what will happen to the total inventory cost if the originally cost of carrying inventories is 12 percent rather than 10 percent?
> In a well-designed BI system, managers themselves can interactively ask the computer these types of questions as often as they need to.
