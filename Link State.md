# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Link [[State]] is a [[routing]] protocol that uses a map of the network to determine the best path for [[data]] packets.

# OVERVIEW:
Link [[State]] is a type of [[routing]] protocol used in computer networks to determine the most efficient path for [[data]] transmission. Unlike distance-vector protocols, which rely on the number of hops to determine the best route, Link [[State]] protocols create a complete map of the network topology. Each router independently calculates the shortest path to every other node using algorithms like Dijkstra's. This approach allows for faster convergence and more accurate [[routing]] decisions, as each router has a comprehensive view of the network. Link [[State]] protocols are commonly used in large, complex networks due to their [[scalability]] and efficiency.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Link [[State]] protocols create a complete map of the network topology.
2. Routers independently calculate the shortest path using algorithms like Dijkstra's.
3. Faster convergence compared to distance-vector protocols.
4. Provides more accurate [[routing]] decisions.
5. Suitable for large, complex networks.
6. Each router maintains a [[database]] of the network's topology.
7. Link [[State]] protocols include [[OSPF]] and IS-IS.
8. Requires more memory and processing power than distance-vector protocols.
9. Updates are triggered by changes in the network topology.
10. Reduces [[routing]] loops and improves network stability.
