## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Queuing delay is the time a [[data]] packet spends waiting in a queue before being processed and transmitted by a network node.

## OVERVIEW:
Queuing delay is a critical component of [[nodal delay]] in network performance, representing the time a [[data]] packet waits in a queue at a network node, such as a router or switch, before it is processed and transmitted. This delay occurs when multiple packets arrive at the node simultaneously or in quick succession, exceeding the node's processing capacity. The length of the queuing delay can vary significantly based on network traffic conditions, congestion levels, and the node's processing capabilities. During periods of high traffic, queuing delays can increase substantially, leading to higher overall latency and potential packet loss if the queue becomes full. Effective queue management strategies, such as prioritisation algorithms and congestion control mechanisms, are essential to minimise queuing delays and maintain optimal network performance. Understanding and managing queuing delay is crucial for ensuring the quality of service, particularly in applications requiring low latency, such as real-time communications, online gaming, and streaming services.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Queuing delay is the wait time in a queue at a network node.
2. Occurs when multiple packets arrive simultaneously or in quick succession.
3. Varies based on network traffic and congestion levels.
4. Increases during periods of high traffic.
5. Can lead to higher overall latency and packet loss.
6. Effective queue management strategies are essential.
7. Prioritisation algorithms [[help]] minimise queuing delays.
8. Congestion control mechanisms improve network performance.
9. Critical for applications requiring low latency.
10. Ensures quality of service in real-time communications and streaming.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Queuing delay occurs when packets wait in a queue at a network node.
2. It varies with network traffic and congestion.
3. High traffic increases queuing delays and potential packet loss.
4. Effective queue management is crucial for minimising delays.
5. Low queuing delay is essential for real-time applications and quality of service.
