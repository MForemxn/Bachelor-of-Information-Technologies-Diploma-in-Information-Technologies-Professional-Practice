# System Development

> System development involves a set of activities for building information systems tailored to users' needs, ranging from small projects to large endeavours across various fields.
- Examples include: 
	- a startup using a cloud-based CRM for cost efficiency
	- a manufacturing company developing a custom inventory system for unique requirements
	- a company purchasing off-the-shelf accounting software for general needs.
- The disastrous IT project of Queensland Health's payroll system, which overran its budget significantly due to poor planning and underestimation of complexity, underscores the importance of meticulous planning in system acquisition and modification.

# Planning for Developing Information System

> Effective information system (IS) planning begins by analysing the organisationâ€™s strategic plan to identify its mission, goals, and necessary steps to achieve these goals.
- The IS strategic plan involves setting IT infrastructure and resource goals to meet organisational objectives, followed by developing an IS operational plan that outlines specific projects to support the strategic plan.
- Success stories of IS planning include: 
	- ABC Healthcare focusing on innovative medical practices and customer-centric platforms
	- a company emphasising sustainable living through enhanced e-commerce platforms and customer relationship management.

# Exploring Strategies for Acquiring Information Systems

- Strategies for acquiring IT applications include:
	- purchasing prewritten applications
	- customising prewritten applications
	- custom-writing entire applications
	- leasing applications
	- employing custom development
		- see Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC), and how it provides a backbone methodology for custom development.
> The decision between subscribing, buying, or building IT solutions involves considering industry best practices, time and resources, and specific organisational needs.
- [[Software as a Service (SaaS)]] offers a convenient model for using software through vendor-hosted applications, presenting advantages like quick access, technical support, and lower costs, but also poses challenges such as security concerns and dependence on stable internet connectivity.

# Exploring Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

- The SDLC is a structured framework used for large-scale IS projects, consisting of several phases: 
	- Systems Investigation
	- Systems Analysis
	- Systems Design
	- Programming and Testing
	- Implementation
	- Operation and Maintenance.
- Initial phases focus on understanding business needs, evaluating system feasibility (technical, economic, behavioural), and gathering user requirements.
- The design phase translates user requirements into technical specifications, including:
	- system outputs
	- inputs
	- user interfaces.
- Implementation strategies include direct, pilot, phased, and parallel conversions, each with its rationale based on organisational needs and project risks.
- Operations and maintenance phase addresses:
	- system longevity
	- requiring debugging
	- updates
	- modifications to accommodate business changes.
