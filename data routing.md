# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
[[Data]] [[routing]] is the [[process]] of selecting paths in a network to efficiently send [[data]] from source to destination.

# OVERVIEW:
[[Data]] [[routing]] is a fundamental aspect of network communication, involving the selection of optimal paths for [[data]] packets to travel from their source to their intended destination. This [[process]] is crucial for ensuring efficient and reliable [[data]] transmission across various types of networks, including local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and [[the internet]]. Routers, which are specialized network devices, play a key role in [[data]] [[routing]] by analyzing network topologies and determining the best paths based on factors such as distance, speed, and network congestion. [[Routing]] protocols, such as [[OSPF]] (Open Shortest Path First) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), provide the necessary algorithms and rules to facilitate dynamic and adaptive [[routing]] decisions. Effective [[data]] [[routing]] minimizes latency, maximizes bandwidth utilization, and enhances overall network performance, making it a critical component of modern communication systems.
