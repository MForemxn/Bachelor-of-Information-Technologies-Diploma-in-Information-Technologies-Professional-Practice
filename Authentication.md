## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Authentication in computer [[security]] confirms the identity of users or systems to ensure that only authorized entities gain access to resources.

## OVERVIEW:
Authentication in computer [[security]] is the [[process]] of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system before granting access to sensitive information and resources. This step is crucial for ensuring that only authorized entities can interact with the system, thereby protecting against unauthorized access and potential [[security]] breaches. Authentication methods can range from simple passwords to more advanced techniques such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), [[biometric]] verification, and digital certificates. The effectiveness of an authentication system directly impacts the overall [[security]] posture of an organization. Strong authentication mechanisms [[help]] in safeguarding [[data integrity]], [[confidentiality]], and [[availability]], while also supporting compliance with regulatory standards. As cyber threats become more sophisticated, the need for robust and adaptive authentication methods becomes increasingly important to mitigate risks and protect assets.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Authentication verifies the identity of users or systems.
2. Ensures only authorized entities access resources.
3. Uses methods like passwords, MFA, and biometrics.
4. Protects against unauthorized access and breaches.
5. Critical for maintaining [[data integrity]] and [[confidentiality]].
6. Supports regulatory compliance.
7. Enhances overall [[security]] posture.
8. Must adapt to evolving cyber threats.
9. Directly impacts organizational [[security]].
10. Essential for safeguarding sensitive information.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Authentication is vital for secure access control.
2. Employs various methods to verify identities.
3. Protects against unauthorized access and breaches.
4. Supports compliance with regulatory standards.
5. Needs to evolve with advancing cyber threats.
