# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
File system management in [[operating systems]] involves organizing, storing, retrieving, and securing [[data]] on storage devices to ensure efficient [[data]] access and [[integrity]].

# OVERVIEW:
File system management is a critical [[function]] of an operating system (OS) that handles the organization and storage of [[data]] on storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, and removable media. It provides a structured way to store and retrieve files, ensuring [[data]] is easily accessible and managed efficiently. The file system defines how [[data]] is named, stored, and retrieved, using structures like directories and files. It supports operations such as file creation, deletion, reading, writing, and modification. File systems also manage [[metadata]], which includes information about file size, type, permissions, and timestamps. [[Security]] is a key aspect, with file systems implementing access controls to protect [[data]] from unauthorized access. Different file systems, such as NTFS, FAT32, ext4, and APFS, offer varying features and performance characteristics. Effective file system management ensures [[data]] [[integrity]], optimizes storage space, and enhances system performance.
