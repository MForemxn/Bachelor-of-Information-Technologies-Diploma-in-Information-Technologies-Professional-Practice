To calculate the mark you need to average for the rest of your tasks to pass the course after failing a 20% weighted assessment, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Impact of the Failed Assessment**: Let's assume the assessment was out of 100 marks. If you failed and scored less than the passing mark (let's say the passing mark is 50), your current score for this assessment is 0.
    
2. **Calculate Your Current Percentage**: Since the assessment was weighted at 20%, the impact on your overall grade is significant. If the assessment was out of 100 marks and you scored 0, your contribution to this 20% is 0% of 20, which doesn't contribute positively to your passing grade.
    
3. **Determine Your Required Average for the Remaining Assessments**: To pass the course, you need to compensate for this 0 in the overall grading. You will have to raise your remaining assessments average grades.
