# What are Number Systems?
- Number systems are mathematical frameworks for representing numbers, each with its own base and set of symbols.
- They provide the foundation for arithmetic operations, data representation, and computing processes.
- Common number systems include binary, decimal, hexadecimal, and octal, each serving specific purposes in mathematics and computing.

# [[Decimal Number System]]
- The decimal system, also known as base-10, is the standard system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers.
- It uses ten symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Predominantly used in daily life and most familiar to the general population.

# [[Binary Number System]]
- The binary system, or base-2, uses only two symbols: 0 and 1.
- Fundamental to digital computing, as it represents the two states of electronic circuitry (off/on, false/true).
- All data in computers, including text, images, and video, are ultimately stored and processed in binary form.

# [[Hexadecimal Number System]]
- The hexadecimal system, or base-16, uses sixteen symbols: 0-9 to represent values zero to nine, and A-F (or a-f) to represent values ten to fifteen.
- Widely used in computing as a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. One hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits (bits), making it simpler to understand and communicate large binary numbers.

# Octal Number System
- The octal system, or base-8, uses eight symbols: 0-7.
- Less common today, but historically used in computing and digital electronics due to its simplicity in converting to and from binary.

# Conversion Between Number Systems
- Converting numbers between different systems is a common task in computing and electronics.
- Techniques vary, but often involve division for converting to a lower base and multiplication for converting to a higher base, along with modular arithmetic.

# Applications of Number Systems
- Binary is essential for the internal functioning of computers and digital systems.
- Decimal is used in general arithmetic and most human-centric applications.
- Hexadecimal is crucial in programming, debugging, and understanding memory addresses and color codes in web design.
- Octal was once used in computing but has largely been supplanted by hexadecimal.

# Understanding Number Systems in Computing
- A fundamental skill for programmers, network engineers, and anyone involved in computer science or information technology.
- Helps in understanding how data is stored, manipulated, and transmitted in digital systems.
- Essential for tasks such as bit manipulation, memory allocation, and error detection/correction algorithms.
