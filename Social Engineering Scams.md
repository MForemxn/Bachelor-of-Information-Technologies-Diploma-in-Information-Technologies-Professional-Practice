# What is Social Engineering?

- Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. In contrast to traditional hacking, which involves breaking into computer systems, social engineering relies on tricking people into breaking normal [[security]] procedures.
- It is often used by cybercriminals to gather sensitive information, such as passwords and bank information, or to gain unauthorized access to systems.

# Common Types of Social Engineering Attacks

## Pretexting
- Pretexting involves creating a fabricated scenario (the pretext) to engage a target in a manner that increases the chance of scam success. The attacker usually pretends to need certain information from the target to confirm their identity, thereby gaining access to sensitive data.

## Phishing/Spear Phishing
- Phishing is a technique that involves sending fraudulent emails that mimic those from reputable sources to steal sensitive information. Spear phishing is a more targeted version, where the attacker has done research on their victim to make the attack more personalized and convincing.

## Vishing
- Vishing, or voice phishing, uses telephone calls to trick individuals into divulging personal information, such as bank details or computer passwords. The caller often pretends to represent a trusted company or institution.

## Smishing
- Smishing is similar to phishing but uses SMS text messages. These messages might prompt the recipient to click on a malicious link or provide personal information under the guise of urgency or legitimacy.

## Baiting
- Baiting involves offering something enticing to the victim in exchange for information or access. This could be in the form of a free download that, when executed, installs malicious software on the victim’s computer.

## Scareware
- Scareware tricks victims into believing their computer is infected with malware, prompting them to install fake anti-virus software that is actually malware or to pay for unnecessary software.

## Ransomware
- Ransomware is a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system or files until a sum of money is paid. It often encrypts files, making them inaccessible to the user.

## Dumpster Diving
- Dumpster diving involves searching through a person's or organization's trash to find confidential information that can be used in further attacks or frauds. It exploits the fact that many people and businesses carelessly throw away sensitive information.

## Shoulder Surfing
- Shoulder surfing is the practice of spying on the user of an ATM, computer, or other electronic device in an attempt to obtain personal or financial information. It can be done close by or through more sophisticated means like using binoculars or surveillance equipment.
## Tailgating
- Tailgating, also known as "piggybacking," involves an unauthorized person following an authorized individual into a restricted area or system without their knowledge or consent. It exploits physical security weaknesses rather than technological ones. The attacker usually waits for someone to open a secure entrance and then follows closely behind, often under the guise of being an employee or a contractor without access credentials. This technique is particularly effective in busy environments where people are less likely to challenge or notice unauthorized entrants.

## Quid Pro Quo
- Quid pro quo attacks involve the attacker offering a benefit or service in exchange for information or access. This type of social engineering plays on the human tendency to engage in a mutual exchange. For example, an attacker might call random numbers within an organization, claiming to be calling back from technical support. The attacker offers assistance in solving a non-existent problem in exchange for the employee's login credentials or other sensitive information. In another scenario, the attacker might offer free software in exchange for login information.

# Conclusion

Tailgating and quid pro quo are social engineering techniques that exploit human nature and the social norms of reciprocity and trust. Tailgating takes advantage of physical security lapses, while quid pro quo manipulates the expectation of a fair exchange for services or information. Awareness and training are key to defending against these tactics, as they help individuals recognize and respond appropriately to unauthorized attempts to gain access or information.

# How Social Engineering Works

- The success of social engineering relies on psychological manipulation, exploiting common human traits such as trust, fear, and the desire to be helpful.
- Attackers often do extensive research on their targets to find vulnerabilities. They may gather preliminary data from social media, company websites, and other public sources to make their attack more credible.
- The actual attack is then carried out using one or more of the methods mentioned above, tailored to exploit the identified vulnerabilities.

# Preventing Social Engineering Attacks

- **Education and Awareness**: Regular training and awareness programs can [[help]] individuals recognize and avoid social engineering tactics.
- **Verification [[Processes]]**: Implementing strict verification [[processes]] for accessing sensitive information or entering secure areas can reduce the risk of successful attacks.
- **[[Security]] Culture**: Fostering a [[security]]-conscious culture within an organization can [[help]] in creating an environment where suspicious activities are promptly reported and addressed.
- **Technical Controls**: Using spam filters, setting up web and email filters, and employing two-factor authentication can add layers of [[security]].

# Challenges in Combating Social Engineering

- **Human Factor**: The biggest challenge in preventing social engineering attacks is the human factor. Even the most sophisticated [[security]] systems can be bypassed through social engineering.
- **Evolving Tactics**: Social engineering tactics are constantly evolving, making it difficult to prepare for every possible attack scenario.
- **Underreporting**: Victims of social engineering often do not report incidents due to embarrassment or fear of repercussions, which can hinder efforts to combat these attacks.
