# What Is [[Cardinality]] in a [[Database]]? (With Types and Examples)

When developing new software programs and databases, there are several modeling concepts you can apply to provide structure and make information easy for users to find. [[Cardinality]] is one of these concepts, and it helps users describe how two different objects or entities relate to each other. Understanding what [[cardinality]] in a [[database]] is can [[help]] you organize a business's [[data]] and increase its efficiency at distributing information.In this article, we explain [[cardinality]] in a [[database]], why it's important and what the three types of [[cardinality]] are.

## What is [[cardinality]] in a [[database]]?

[[Cardinality]] is a mathematical term that refers to the number of elements in a given set. [[Database]] administrators](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-become-database-administrator) may use [[cardinality]] to count tables and values. In a [[database]], [[cardinality]] usually represents the relationship between the [[data]] in two different tables by highlighting how many times a specific entity occurs in comparison to another. For example, the [[database]] of an auto repair shop may show that a mechanic works with multiple customers every day. This means that the relationship between the mechanic entity and the customer entity is one mechanic to many customers.In this example, note that each customer has exactly one vehicle that they bring to the auto repair shop during their visit. This means the relationship between the customer entity and the car entity is a one-to-one relationship. Using [[cardinality]] can [[help]] [[database]] administrators automatically establish these relationships in a software program or [[database]]. This can make it easy for users to see the correlation between mechanics, customers and cars when searching for specific [[data]] or files.Related: [What Are the Different Types of [[Database]] Management?](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/what-is-database-management)

## Why's [[cardinality]] important in databases?

[[Cardinality]] is important in databases because it creates links from one table or entity to another in a structured manner. This has a significant impact on the query execution plan, which is a sequence of steps users can take to search for and access [[data]] within a [[database]] system. Having a well-structured query execution plan can make it easier for users to locate the [[data]] they need quickly. [[Database]] administrators can apply [[cardinality]] to databases for various reasons, but businesses typically use the [[cardinality]] model to analyze information about their customers or [inventory numbers](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-inventory-management).For example, an online retailer may have a [[database]] table that lists each one of its unique customers. It may also have another [[database]] table that lists all the purchases customers have made from its store. Since it's likely that each customer purchased multiple items from the store, the [database administrator](https://www.indeed.com/q-database-administrator-jobs.html) may represent this pattern by using a one-to-many [[cardinality]] relationship that links each customer in the first table to all the purchases they made in the second table.Related: [Learn About Being a Database Administrator](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/careers/what-does-a-database-administrator-do)

## Types of [[cardinality]] in databases

There are three types of [[cardinality]] that may apply to a [[database]]. These three types are one-to-one relationships, one-to-many relationships and many-to-many relationships. Here are definitions and examples for each type of [[cardinality]]:

### One-to-one relationship

A one-to-one (1:1) relationship describes a situation where one occurrence of an entity relates to exactly one occurrence of another entity. You might see this type of [[cardinality]] in a [[database]] if you're working with one row in a specific table that relates to one row in a different table. Most [[database]] administrators agree that this is the least common type of relationship that occurs in databases.Example: A school may use [[cardinality]] in its student [[database]] to show a one-to-one relationship between each student and their student ID number. The school only assigns one ID number per student. As a result, using this modeling concept can [[help]] faculty members look up a student's ID number quickly if they need to create a replacement card or use it to access a specific file.Related: [A Guide to [[Data]] Classification (With Types and Examples)](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/data-classification)

### One-to-many relationship

A one-to-many (1:N) relationship describes a situation where one occurrence in an entity relates to many occurrences in another entity. You might see this type of [[cardinality]] in a [[database]] if you're working with one row in a specific table that relates to multiple rows in a different table. The one-to-many relationship is the most common type of relationship, as you can use it to store [[data]] in any relational [[database]].Example: An online food delivery service may create a [[data]] table to store all its customer ID numbers. It may also create another table for unique order ID numbers. Each order ID number must correlate with the specific customer ID number of the person who placed the order. Many order ID numbers may relate back to a single customer ID number. A [[database]] developer](https://www.indeed.com/q-database-developer-jobs.html)can use [[cardinality]] to establish this as a one-to-many relationship to make it easy for other team members to connect each customer with all of the orders they've placed.Related: [Data Entry Skills: Definition and 6 Steps To Improve Yours](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/[[data]]-entry-skills)

### Many-to-many relationship

A many-to-many (M:N) relationship describes a situation where multiple occurrences in one entity relate to multiple occurrences in another entity. You might see this type of [[cardinality]] in a [[database]] if you're working with several rows in a specific table that relate to several rows in another table. Many-to-many relationships can be confusing to study, so some [[database]] administrators can opt to divide a many-to-many relationship into several one-to-many relationships.Example: A book retailer may use the many-to-many relationship model to manage its online [[database]]. It might include a list of book titles in one table and a list of author names in another table. Many of the authors may have multiple books and some of the authors may have even co-written books together. This means that a single author may have a relationship with more than one book and a single book may have a relationship with more than one author. By using the many-to-many relationship model, the retailer can quickly assess which authors and books belong together.Related: [6 Methods of [[Data]] Collection (With Types and Examples)](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/methods-of-[[[[data]]]]-collection)

## Frequently asked questions about [[cardinality]] in databases

Here are some answers to frequently asked questions about [[cardinality]] in databases:

### How's [[cardinality]] different from modality?

While [[cardinality]] and modality are both modeling concepts that professionals use in [[database]] design to analyze entities and their relationships with each other, there are some key differences between these two methods. [[Cardinality]] measures the maximum number of associations between two different table rows or columns. Alternatively, modality represents whether a relationship between two or more entities exists at all. In other words, modality focuses on the minimum number of associations, whether a relationship is mandatory and if the relationship is null.Related: [What Is [[Data]] Modeling?](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/[[[[data]]]]-modeling)

### What's an entity-relationship (ER) diagram?

An ER diagram [visually represents](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/visual-communication) the [[cardinality]] that a specific [[database]] contains. An ER diagram often appears as a flowchart that shows how different entities in a [[database]] relate to one another. A [[database]] analyst](https://www.indeed.com/q-[[database]]-analyst-jobs.html) may use an ER diagram to design, upgrade or troubleshoot a relational [[database]] system. ER diagrams are beneficial because they can [[help]] [[database]] analysts and system users quickly identify where the [[data]]'s location and how it links together.Related: [28 Flowchart Symbols and Their Meanings](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/28-flowchart-symbols-and-meanings)

### What's the difference between high and low [[cardinality]]?

High [[cardinality]] describes a [[data]] set that has a large number of unique values or entities. This represents a significant level of diversity and very little [[repetition]]. For example, a [[data]] set that lists the name of each unique customer would have high [[cardinality]] because the names are likely to vary. Low [[cardinality]] refers to a [[data]] set that has a large quantity of the same values or entities. In a low [[cardinality]] [[data]] set, many of the same entities repeat themselves and there's less variety. For example, a [[data]] set that lists the category of each product for a small retail store may have low [[cardinality]] because there are only a few categories that are likely to repeat.
