# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics principles to perform complex computations faster than classical computers, revolutionising various industries.

# OVERVIEW:
Quantum computing is an advanced field of computing that utilises the principles of quantum mechanics to process information. Unlike classical computers, which use bits as the smallest unit of data, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, thanks to superposition, allowing quantum computers to perform many calculations at once. Another key principle is entanglement, where qubits become interconnected, enabling faster and more efficient problem-solving. Quantum computing holds the potential to revolutionise industries by solving complex problems that are currently infeasible for classical computers, such as drug discovery, cryptography, and optimisation problems. Despite its promise, quantum computing is still in its early stages, with challenges like qubit stability and error rates needing to be addressed. However, ongoing research and development continue to push the boundaries of what quantum computing can achieve.
