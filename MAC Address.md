# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a network [[interface]] card (NIC) for communication on a local network.

# OVERVIEW:
A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a hardware identifier that uniquely identifies each device on a local network. It is a 48-bit address typically represented as six pairs of hexadecimal digits, such as 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E. MAC addresses are embedded into the network [[interface]] card (NIC) by the manufacturer and are used for communication within the same network segment. Unlike IP addresses, which can change, MAC addresses are permanent and unique to each device. They play a crucial role in network protocols, such as Ethernet, by ensuring that [[data]] packets are delivered to the correct hardware. MAC addresses are essential for [[network security]], allowing for device [[identification]] and access control. They are also used in network troubleshooting and management to track and manage devices on a network.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. MAC address uniquely identifies network devices.
2. Consists of 48 bits, shown in hexadecimal format.
3. Embedded in the network [[interface]] card (NIC).
4. Used for local network communication.
5. Permanent and unique to each device.
6. Essential for Ethernet and other network protocols.
7. Important for [[network security]] and access control.
8. Helps in network troubleshooting and management.
9. Different from IP addresses, which can change.
10. Used to ensure correct [[data]] packet delivery.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. MAC addresses uniquely identify devices on a network.
2. They are permanent and embedded in hardware.
3. Crucial for local network communication and [[security]].
4. Used in network management and troubleshooting.
5. Different from IP addresses, which are more flexible.
