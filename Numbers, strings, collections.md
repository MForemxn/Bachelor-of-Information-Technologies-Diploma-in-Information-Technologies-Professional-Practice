# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:  
Numbers, strings, and collections in [[Swift]] are fundamental [[data]] types that enable efficient [[data]] manipulation, storage, and retrieval, forming the backbone of [[Swift]] programming.

# OVERVIEW:  
In [[Swift]], numbers, strings, and collections are essential [[data]] types that provide the foundation for [[data]] manipulation and storage. Numbers in [[Swift]] include various types such as Int, [[Float]], and Double, allowing for precise numerical operations. Strings are used to represent and manipulate text, offering powerful features like interpolation and Unicode support. Collections, including arrays, dictionaries, and sets, enable the storage and management of multiple values in an organised manner. Arrays store ordered lists of elements, dictionaries hold key-value pairs, and sets manage unique elements. These [[data]] types are designed to be safe, efficient, and easy to use, leveraging [[Swift]]'s strong type system and modern [[syntax]] to ensure code reliability and performance.
