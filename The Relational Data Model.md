## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The relational [[data]] model organises [[data]] into tables (relations) with rows and columns, enabling efficient [[data]] management and retrieval.

## OVERVIEW:
The relational [[data]] model is a framework for organising [[data]] into structured tables, known as relations, which consist of rows and columns. Each table represents a specific entity, and each row corresponds to a unique record, while columns represent the [[attributes]] of the entity. This model uses [[keys]] to establish relationships between tables, ensuring [[data]] [[integrity]] and reducing redundancy. The relational [[data]] model supports powerful querying capabilities through [[Structured Query Language (SQL)]], allowing users to perform complex operations on the [[data]]. It is widely used due to its simplicity, [[flexibility]], and ability to handle large volumes of [[data]] efficiently. The model's foundation on mathematical principles ensures consistency and reliability, making it a preferred choice for many [[database]] management systems.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Organises [[data]] into structured tables (relations).
2. Tables consist of rows (records) and columns ([[attributes]]).
3. Uses [[keys]] to establish relationships between tables.
4. Ensures [[data]] [[integrity]] and reduces redundancy.
5. Supports powerful querying with SQL.
6. Handles large volumes of [[data]] efficiently.
7. Based on mathematical principles for consistency.
8. Provides [[flexibility]] in [[data]] management.
9. Widely used in [[database]] management systems.
10. Preferred for its simplicity and reliability.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Relational [[data]] model structures [[data]] into tables with rows and columns.
2. [[Keys]] establish relationships and ensure [[data]] [[integrity]].
3. SQL enables complex [[data]] operations.
4. Efficiently manages large [[data]] volumes.
5. Valued for its simplicity, [[flexibility]], and reliability.
