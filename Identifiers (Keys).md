## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Identifiers, including primary and foreign keys, are unique attributes used to establish and maintain relationships between entities in a database.

## OVERVIEW:
Identifiers, commonly referred to as keys, are crucial elements in database design that uniquely identify records and establish relationships between different tables. The primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table, ensuring that no two rows have the same primary key value. It is essential for maintaining data integrity and enabling efficient data retrieval. Foreign keys, on the other hand, are attributes in one table that reference the primary key of another table, creating a link between the two tables. This relationship enforces referential integrity, ensuring that the data remains consistent and accurate across the database. Proper use of primary and foreign keys is fundamental for relational database design, as it allows for complex queries, data integrity, and the establishment of meaningful relationships between different data entities.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Identifiers uniquely identify records in a database.
2. Primary keys are unique identifiers for table records.
3. Ensure no duplicate rows in a table.
4. Foreign keys reference primary keys in other tables.
5. Create relationships between different tables.
6. Enforce referential integrity across the database.
7. Crucial for maintaining data consistency and accuracy.
8. Enable complex queries and data retrieval.
9. Fundamental for relational database design.
10. Support meaningful relationships between data entities.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Primary keys uniquely identify each record in a table.
2. Foreign keys link tables by referencing primary keys.
3. Keys ensure data integrity and consistency.
4. Proper use of keys enables complex data relationships.
