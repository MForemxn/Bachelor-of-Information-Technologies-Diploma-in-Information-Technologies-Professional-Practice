# IT Security Performance Management
- The process of designing, implementing and managing the use of collected data elements called measures to determine the effectiveness of the overall security program
	- Information security measures
		- Measures refers to aggregate, higher‚Äêlevel results
	- Information security metrics
		- Applying statistical and quantitative approaches of mathematical analysis to the process of measuring the activities and outcomes of the cyber/information security program
# Performance Management
- In an increasingly regulated business environment,
	- it is no longer acceptable to simply claim the effectiveness of a [[cybersecurity]] program.
	- performance measurement is increasing required to prove the effectiveness of your [[cybersecurity]] program
- Establishing an effective [[cybersecurity]] program is a process, and a process can only be improved upon if it is measured
- Performance measurements have many advantages including
	- know your crown jewels
	- knowing strengths and weak areas
	- enabling improvement potentials
	- directing resources to the most needed area
## IT Security Performance Management

- **Definition**: The process of designing, implementing, and managing measures to determine the effectiveness of the overall security program.
- **Key Concepts**:
    - **Measures**: Aggregate, higher-level results.
    - **Metrics**: Statistical and quantitative approaches to analyzing security program performance.

### Why Performance Measurement is Important

- It is necessary to **prove** the effectiveness of [[cybersecurity]] programs in a regulated business environment.
- **Performance measurements** help in:
    - Identifying critical assets ("crown jewels").
    - Pinpointing strengths and weaknesses.
    - Improving security and resource allocation.

### Types of Measures

1. **Effectiveness of security policy execution**.
2. **Efficiency of security service delivery**.
3. **Impact of incidents on the organization**.

## [[Cybersecurity]] Practice Management

- Measures the **quality** and effectiveness of a [[cybersecurity]] program.
- Questions addressed:
    - Is the security service adequate?
    - Are the security services implemented reliably?

### Data Collection for Performance Metrics

- Metrics should be **objective, measurable**, and **comparable** over time.
- **Examples**:
    - Incident management (e.g., cost of incidents, time to recovery).
    - Vulnerability management (e.g., % of systems with no vulnerabilities).
    - Patch management (e.g., patch coverage, time to patch).
    - Configuration management, application security, financial metrics (e.g., IT security budget).

## Qualitative Security Metrics

- Measures security knowledge and attitudes among employees:
    - **Awareness**: % of employees signing policies, completing training.
    - **Attitude**: % of employees who know there is a security group or believe security hinders their job.

## Security Management Practice

### Security Benchmarking

- Compares your security program against a peer group to identify performance gaps and best practices.
- **Benchmarking methods**:
    - **Metric-based**: Based on numerical data.
    - **Process-based**: Focus on processes used to achieve goals.

### Standards of Due Care and Due Diligence

- **Due Care**: Implementing controls that meet a minimum standard.
- **Due Diligence**: Ensuring the controls continue to provide required protection.

---

## Human Factor in [[Cybersecurity]]

- **Humans** are both the strongest defense and weakest link in information security.
- **Attack Surface**: The sum of security risks, including vulnerabilities introduced by people.
- **Human attack surface** includes:
    - Negligence, errors, insider threats, and susceptibility to social engineering.

---

## Security Education, Training, and Awareness (SETA)

- **Purpose**: Improve security culture through education, training, and awareness programs.
- **SETA Program**:
    - Improves awareness and security knowledge.
    - Helps employees perform jobs securely.
    - Typically led by the **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**.

### SETA Program Development Process:

1. **Set realistic goals**.
2. **Design** the program.
3. **Develop** the training content.
4. **Implement** the training.
5. **Optimize** by measuring effectiveness.

### Training Levels:

1. **Basic**: Visible risks, policy focus, general topics.
2. **Intermediate**: Hidden risks, security in business processes.
3. **Advanced**: In-depth security controls, tools, and management.

---

## [[Cybersecurity]] Awareness Training

- **Goal**: Reduce risks by improving knowledge and adherence to best practices.
- **Delivery Methods**:
    - Mugs, posters, security alerts, workshops, online training, simulations.
- **Selecting Methods**:
    - Choose delivery methods that are suitable for the content, interactive, and cause minimal disruption.

### Evaluating Effectiveness

- Use simulations, quizzes, baselining, and benchmarking to assess training impact.
