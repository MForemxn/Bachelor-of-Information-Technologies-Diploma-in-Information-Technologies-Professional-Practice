# Protocols that use [[TLS]]
- [[HTTP]]
- [[SMTP]]
- [[POP3]]
- [[IMAP]]
- [[FTP]]
- [[SIP]]
# The [[TLS]] Layer
- [[TLS]] sits between the transport and [[application layer]]
	- unprotected [[data]] is given to [[TLS]] by the [[application layer]]
	- [[TLS]] handles the [[encryption]], decryption, and [[integrity]] checks
	- [[TLS]] supports protected [[data]] to the [[transport layer]]
# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
[[Transport Layer]] [[Security]] ([[TLS]]) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network.

# OVERVIEW:
[[Transport Layer]] [[Security]] ([[TLS]]) is a protocol that ensures privacy and [[data]] [[integrity]] between two communicating applications. It is widely used to secure web browsers, email, messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP) services. [[TLS]] evolved from the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol and is considered more secure and efficient. It operates at the [[transport layer]] of the [[OSI model]], encrypting [[data]] before it is transmitted over the network. [[TLS]] uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric [[cryptography]] to establish a secure connection, authenticate parties, and exchange [[keys]]. The protocol supports various [[encryption]] algorithms and provides mechanisms for negotiating the best available [[security]] options between client and server. [[TLS]] also includes features like message [[authentication]] codes (MACs) to ensure [[data]] [[integrity]] and prevent tampering. Its widespread adoption is crucial for maintaining the [[confidentiality]] and [[security]] of online communications, protecting against eavesdropping, [[data]] breaches, and [[man]]-in-the-middle attacks.
