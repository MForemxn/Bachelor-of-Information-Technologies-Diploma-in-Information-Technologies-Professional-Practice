You should try to learn some words of the language. Go to the [EWB Design Brief](https://canvas.uts.edu.au/courses/30531/files/6481207?wrap=1 "DESIGN BRIEF_EWB Challenge 2024 - Saibai-1.pdf") [Download EWB Design Brief](https://canvas.uts.edu.au/courses/30531/files/6481207/download?download_frd=1). Find out the main language spoken on Saibai and the language used as trading language throughout the region. 
	1. Language: **Kalaw Kawaw Ya**
	2. Maapu: Heavy
	3. Maalu: Deep/Deep Water
	4. Laba- : Cut/Hack/Strike
	5. wœiwi: Mango

2. Draw a map of Saibai Island showing its position compared to Australia and Papua New Guinea. Mark the major settlement on the map. You can find the settlement on the Wikipedia page.

3. Lets think about the people you are going to meet. What do most people do in the Torres Straits? What else do they do to find food?
	1. In the Torres Strait Islands, people mainly fish and garden for food, using traditional methods. Fishing involves lines, nets, and spears, while gardening produces crops like yams and sweet potatoes. Some also hunt for animals such as pigs and birds. This lifestyle connects them closely to the sea and land, sustaining their food sources and cultural heritage.

4. What activities are used to tell young people about their culture? How do you think climate change may affect this?
	1. In the Torres Strait Islands, young people learn about their culture through activities like storytelling, festivals, art, language preservation, and environmental stewardship. However, climate change threatens these traditions:
		1. **Loss of Land**: Rising sea levels may flood islands, displacing communities and disrupting cultural practices.
		2. **Changes to Traditional Activities**: Weather changes affect fishing, gardening, and hunting, impacting food and traditions.
		3. **Loss of Cultural Sites**: Erosion and storms damage sacred sites, erasing cultural history.
		4. **Language and Knowledge Loss**: Displacement can lead to the loss of language and traditional knowledge.
	2. To protect culture, efforts must focus on preserving traditions alongside environmental conservation and community resilience.

**ENOUGH HOLIDAY DREAMING TEAM THIS IS SERIOUS PREPARATION TIME!!! SERIOUS MEANS GETTING LEGAL FOR A MOMENT.**  

 5. What rights does the 1978 Torres Strait Island Treaty acknowledge?  Why do you think this is important?
	 1. The 1978 Torres Strait Island Treaty acknowledges the traditional rights of Torres Strait Islanders to fish and hunt in their waters and on their islands. It allows free movement between Australia and Papua New Guinea for cultural activities and family visits without passports. This treaty is important as it recognizes Indigenous rights, fosters cross-border cooperation, and supports the preservation of Torres Strait Islander culture and way of life.

**OK, SO YOU DID NOT COME TO UNI TO STUDY LAW RIGHT? YOU WANT TO BUILD STUFF? DESIGN? SAVE THE PLANET? Well guess what – so do EWB and the Torres Strait Island Regional Council! That is why they have engaged your team.**  

6. Go to **Design Area 1** in the **EWB web project brief** – you will see how important an issue waste management is to your partners. In one sentence, sum up the main issue with managing waste on Saibai.

7. **TIME TO ROLL YOUR DIE! THE CLOCK IS TICKING**!  Depending on the number you roll you are to work as a team to collect facts as fast as you can.  
	1. The big problem with waste on Saibai Island is that there's not enough space for it, strict rules about how to handle it, and it costs a lot to get rid of it. Also, mainland solutions don't work well here.

If you roll 1, go into Design Area 1 and write down 1 key point**  

**If you roll 2, go into D.A. 2 and write down 2 key points etc……** 

**Your team will have 3 rolls of the die. GO!!!!!!!** 

**GREAT WORK TEAM YOU ARE NEARLY FINISHED….ONE LAST PIECE OF INVESTIGATION AND DESIGN BEFORE YOU CAN WORK WITH YOUR MAJOR STAKEHOLDERS.**  

If you need more paper put your hand up! Otherwise turn your page over (let us think sustainably) and get out your textas! **You will need to present the next bit.**  

8. One of the specific considerations in the Design Brief is interconnectivity. Choose one of the challenges and outline at least three ways your challenge is connected to the other challenges. You can find examples of this on page 13 of the Design Brief
	1. **Limited Space and Landfill Capacity**: The accumulation of waste along coastlines contributes to the strain on available landfill space. As more waste washes ashore, it occupies valuable land that could be used for other purposes, exacerbating the issue of limited space for landfilling.
	2. **Environmental Impact and Ecosystem Health**: Discarded materials, such as ghost fishing nets, pose environmental hazards to marine ecosystems and wildlife. They can entangle marine animals, disrupt habitats, and introduce harmful pollutants into the environment, affecting the overall health of the ecosystem and contributing to the broader environmental challenges faced by the island.
	3. **Biosecurity Concerns**: Waste washed ashore may also pose biosecurity risks if it contains invasive species or pathogens. Strict biosecurity regulations may require additional measures for the disposal or treatment of such waste, adding complexity to waste management practices and increasing the need for effective waste management solutions to address these concerns.
