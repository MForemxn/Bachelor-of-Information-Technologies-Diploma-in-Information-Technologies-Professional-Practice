# [[Risk Identification]]
Risk [[[identification]]](app://obsidian.md/identification) in [cybersecurity](app://obsidian.md/cybersecurity) involves recognising potential threats and vulnerabilities to protect [information systems](app://obsidian.md/information%20systems) and [data](app://obsidian.md/[[data]]) from cyber attacks.
## Asset [[Identification]] 
> Asset [[Identification]] refers to the [[Process]] of cataloguing and understanding all assets within an organisation that need protection from [[cybersecurity]] threats.  
## Threat [[Identification]] 
> Threat [[Identification]] involves identifying potential sources of harm, such as cyber attacks, that could exploit vulnerabilities within an organisation's assets.  
## Vulnerability [[Identification]] 
> Vulnerability [[Identification]] is the [[Process]] of finding and evaluating weaknesses in an organisation's [[information systems]] that could be exploited by threats.
# [[Risk Evaluation]]
[[Risk evaluation]] in [[[cybersecurity]]](app://obsidian.md/[[cybersecurity]]) assesses the potential impact and likelihood of identified risks to prioritise mitigation efforts effectively.
## Risk Determination
> Risk Determination involves assessing identified risks to decide their potential impact on the organisation, guiding prioritisation and response strategies.
## [[Risk Analysis]]
> [[Risk Analysis]] is the [[Process]] of evaluating the identified risks to understand their potential consequences and likelihood, helping to inform [[decision]]-making.
### Quantitative Analysis
> Quantitative Analysis uses numerical [[data]] and statistical methods to estimate the probability and impact of risks, providing a measurable approach to [[risk management]].
### Qualitative Analysis
> Qualitative Analysis involves assessing risks based on subjective judgment, using descriptions and categorisations to evaluate the severity and likelihood of risks.
## Cost Benefit Analysis
> Cost Benefit Analysis compares the costs of implementing [[security]] measures against the expected benefits, helping to determine the most cost-effective way to manage risks.
# [[Risk Treatment]]
[[Risk treatment]] in [[cybersecurity]] involves selecting and implementing measures to mitigate, transfer, accept, or avoid identified risks to protect [[information systems]].
## Risk Appetite
> Risk Appetite refers to the amount and type of risk that an organisation is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives, influencing [[decision]]-making and strategy.
## Residual Risk
> Residual Risk is the level of risk that remains after risk control measures have been implemented, representing the potential exposure even with controls in place.
## Risk Control Strategies
> Risk Control Strategies are the methods and actions used to manage, reduce, or eliminate identified risks, ensuring that the organisation's risk levels align with its risk appetite.
