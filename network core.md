# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The network core is the central part of a network infrastructure that ensures high-speed, reliable [[data]] transmission between different network segments.

# OVERVIEW:
The network core is a critical component of network architecture, responsible for the high-speed and reliable transmission of [[data]] across various segments of a network. It serves as the backbone of the network, connecting different edge networks, [[data]] centres, and other core networks. The core network is designed to handle large volumes of [[data]] with minimal latency, ensuring efficient and stable communication. It comprises high-capacity routers, switches, and other networking equipment that facilitate the rapid forwarding of [[data]] packets. The core network employs advanced [[routing]] protocols and technologies to optimise [[data]] paths and manage traffic loads, thereby maintaining network performance and reliability. Redundancy and fault tolerance are key features of the core network, ensuring that [[data]] transmission continues smoothly even in the event of hardware failures or network congestion. Overall, the network core plays a vital role in supporting the seamless operation of modern communication systems, enabling services such as internet access, cloud computing, and large-scale [[data]] transfers.
