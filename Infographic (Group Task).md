# Summary of Article
The Harvard Business Review IdeaCast episode, hosted by Curt Nickisch, features Joshua Gans, a strategy professor at the University of Torontoâ€™s Rotman School of Management. The discussion centers on the importance of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) within the right system for effective [[decision]]-making and transformation within organizations. Gans emphasizes that while AI can improve prediction and [[decision]]-making, its full potential is realized only when it is part of a coordinated system that accounts for ripple effects across an organization.

Key points from the episode include:

- The recent hype around AI led businesses to invest in leveraging their data for AI, but challenges emerged due to the need for comprehensive coordination across the entire organizational system, highlighting the "AI bullwhip effect."
- Despite the slow adoption of AI beyond major tech firms, there's a consensus that AI's transformative impact requires a system-wide adjustment rather than isolated implementations.
- Gans provides an example of Team New Zealand in the America's Cup, demonstrating how AI can accelerate innovation in technology and design through enhanced prediction and simulation capabilities.
- The conversation also addresses the difficulty organizations face in adapting to AI, often hindered by established rules and procedures developed in response to uncertainty. Gans suggests that startups and new entrants, unencumbered by legacy systems, are better positioned to harness AI from the outset.
- CEOs and leaders are encouraged to understand the significant uncertainties their organizations face and to consider how AI could transform critical aspects of their operations. This may involve rethinking major decisions and preparing the organization for substantial system changes.
- Gans highlights the gradual pace at which technology and systems evolve, drawing a parallel with the historical adoption of electricity. He advises managers to navigate the shift in power dynamics that accompanies systemic change, emphasising the importance of management skills in facilitating transformation.
