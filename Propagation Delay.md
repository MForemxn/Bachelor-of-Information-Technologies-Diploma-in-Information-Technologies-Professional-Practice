## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Propagation delay is the time it takes for a [[data]] packet to travel from one network node to another, determined by the physical distance and the speed of signal transmission.

## OVERVIEW:
Propagation delay is a fundamental aspect of network latency, representing the time required for a [[data]] packet to travel from one network node to another across a physical medium, such as a fibre optic cable, copper wire, or wireless link. This delay is primarily influenced by the physical distance between the nodes and the speed at which the signal propagates through the medium. The speed of signal transmission is typically close to the speed of light in a vacuum but can be slower in different media. Propagation delay is calculated by dividing the distance between the nodes by the speed of signal transmission. For example, if the distance is 1,000 kilometres and the signal speed is 200,000 kilometres per second, the propagation delay would be 5 milliseconds. Unlike [[transmission delay]], which depends on packet size and link bandwidth, propagation delay is solely a [[function]] of distance and signal speed. Minimising propagation delay is crucial for applications requiring low latency, such as real-time communications, online gaming, and high-frequency trading.
