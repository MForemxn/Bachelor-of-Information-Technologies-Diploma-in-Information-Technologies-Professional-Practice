- cloud computing infrastructure refers to the combination of hardware and software components that make up cloud computing
- includes servers, storage, network devices, and virtualisation software
# Types of Cloud Computing Services
- cloud services are generally categorised into three main types:
	- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
		- provides virtualised computing resources over [[the internet]]
	- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
		- offers hardware and software tools over [[the internet]], typically for application development
	- [[Software as a Service (SaaS)]]
		- delivers software applications over [[the internet]], on a subscription basis
# Deployment [[Models]]
- cloud computing can be deployed in different [[models]] based on the requirements:
	- Public Cloud
		- services are delivered over the public internet and available to anyone willing to pay
	- Private Cloud
		- infrastructure is maintained on a private network, tailored for a single organisation
	- Hybrid Cloud
		- combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them
# Benefits of Cloud Computing
- cloud computing offers several advantages:
	- scalability
		- resources can be scaled up or down based on demand
	- cost efficiency
		- reduces the need for upfront investment in hardware and reduces operational costs
	- accessibility
		- services can be accessed from anywhere, at any time, as long as there is internet connectivity
	- disaster recovery
		- enhances data safety through backup and recovery solutions
# Challenges and Considerations
- while cloud computing offers numerous benefits, there are challenges:
	- [[security]] and privacy
		- concerns over data [[security]] and privacy remain paramount
	- compliance
		- organisations must ensure they comply with regulations governing [[data protection]] and privacy
	- dependency on network connectivity
		- requires a stable and fast internet connection for optimal performance
	- managing costs
		- while cost-effective, unexpected fees and charges can arise, requiring careful management
# Future of Cloud Computing
- the future of cloud computing looks promising, with trends indicating:
	- increased adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud strategies
	- growth in edge computing, where [[data processing]] occurs closer to the source of data
	- advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities within cloud platforms
	- greater emphasis on sustainability, with cloud providers aiming to reduce their carbon footprint
