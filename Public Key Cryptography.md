# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Public key [[cryptography]] uses asymmetric key pairs for secure communication, enabling [[encryption]], decryption, and digital signatures without sharing private [[keys]].

# OVERVIEW:
Public key [[cryptography]], also known as asymmetric [[cryptography]], is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of [[keys]]: a public key and a private key. The public key is openly shared and used for encrypting [[data]] or verifying digital signatures, while the private key is kept secret and used for decrypting [[data]] or creating digital signatures. This system ensures secure communication over insecure channels, as only the intended recipient with the private key can decrypt the message. Public key [[cryptography]] is foundational to many [[security]] protocols, including SSL/TLS for secure web browsing, email [[encryption]], and blockchain technologies. It eliminates the need for exchanging secret [[keys]], reducing the risk of interception. Despite its advantages, public key [[cryptography]] requires more computational resources than symmetric key [[cryptography]], making it slower for large [[data]] volumes.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Public key [[cryptography]] uses asymmetric key pairs: public and private [[keys]].
2. The public key is used for [[encryption]] and verifying signatures.
3. The private key is used for decryption and creating signatures.
4. It enables secure communication over insecure channels.
5. Only the private key holder can decrypt messages encrypted with the public key.
6. It is essential for SSL/TLS, email [[encryption]], and blockchain.
7. Eliminates the need for exchanging secret [[keys]].
8. Reduces the risk of key interception.
9. Requires more computational resources than symmetric [[cryptography]].
10. Slower for large [[data]] volumes compared to symmetric [[cryptography]].

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Public key [[cryptography]] uses asymmetric [[keys]] for secure communication.
2. Public [[keys]] encrypt [[data]]; private [[keys]] decrypt it.
