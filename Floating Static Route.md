## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
A floating static route is a backup route with a higher administrative distance, activated when primary routes fail.

## OVERVIEW:
A floating static route is a type of static route used in network configurations as a backup path, activated only when the primary route becomes unavailable. It is configured with a higher administrative distance than the primary route, ensuring it remains inactive until needed. This approach provides redundancy and enhances network reliability by automatically redirecting traffic through the backup route in case of a failure in the primary route. Floating static routes are particularly useful in scenarios where network uptime is critical, as they ensure continuous connectivity without manual intervention. They are often used in conjunction with [[dynamic routing protocols]] to provide a seamless failover mechanism. Proper configuration is essential to ensure that the floating static route activates correctly and efficiently when required. Overall, floating static routes are a valuable tool for maintaining network stability and ensuring uninterrupted service.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Used as a backup route in network configurations.
2. Activated when the primary route fails.
3. Configured with a higher administrative distance.
4. Provides redundancy and enhances network reliability.
5. Ensures continuous connectivity without manual intervention.
6. Useful in critical network uptime scenarios.
7. Works with [[dynamic routing]] protocols for seamless failover.
8. Requires proper configuration for effective activation.
9. Maintains network stability and uninterrupted service.
10. Valuable for ensuring network resilience and reliability.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Floating static routes provide backup [[routing]] for increased reliability.
2. They activate only when primary routes fail.
3. Configured with higher administrative distances for backup purposes.
4. Essential for maintaining continuous network connectivity.
5. Enhance network resilience and stability through automatic failover.
