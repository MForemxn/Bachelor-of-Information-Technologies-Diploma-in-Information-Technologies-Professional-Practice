 Determine whether to prioritize more results or higher quality results based on your product's goals.
- When designing your [[AI]]-powered product, evaluate the trade-offs between having the set of recommendations your system gives to be broad (prioritizing [recall](https://pair.withgoogle.com/chapter/glossary/)) or accurate (prioritizing [precision](https://pair.withgoogle.com/chapter/glossary/)). This [[decision]] will have a big impact on the end user experience.

# What are Precision and Recall Tradeoffs??
- precision and recall are metrics used to evaluate the performance of classification [[models]] in machine learning and information retrieval
- precision measures the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model
	- it is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions (true positives + false positives)
- recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the ability of the model to identify all relevant instances
	- it is the ratio of true positive predictions to the actual positives in the data (true positives + false negatives)

# Precision and Recall Tradeoffs
- improving precision typically reduces recall and vice versa
	- this is known as the precision-recall tradeoff
- when a model makes very few positive predictions but with high confidence, precision is high but recall may be low
	- the model is very accurate with its positive predictions but misses many actual positives
- conversely, when a model identifies most of the actual positives but also makes many false positive predictions, recall is high but precision is low
	- the model captures most of the relevant instances but at the cost of accuracy

# Importance in Different Contexts
- the importance of precision vs. recall depends on the specific application
	- in medical diagnostics, high recall might be prioritised to ensure all potential cases are identified, even if it means some false positives
	- in spam detection, high precision might be more important to avoid marking legitimate emails as spam

# Balancing Precision and Recall
- F1 score is a commonly used metric to balance precision and recall
	- it is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, giving equal weight to both
- adjusting the classification threshold of a model can also [[help]] manage the tradeoff
	- lowering the threshold increases recall but may decrease precision, and vice versa

# Visualising Precision and Recall
- Precision-Recall curves are a useful tool for visualising the tradeoff
	- these curves plot precision and recall for different threshold values
	- they [[help]] in understanding how changing the threshold affects the balance between precision and recall

# Conclusion
- understanding the precision and recall tradeoff is crucial for developing effective classification [[models]]
- the optimal balance depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application
- tools like the F1 score and Precision-Recall curves aid in navigating and optimising this tradeoff
