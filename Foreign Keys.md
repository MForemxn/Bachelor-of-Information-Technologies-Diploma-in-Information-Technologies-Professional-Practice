## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Foreign [[keys]] are [[database]] constraints that establish a relationship between two tables, ensuring referential [[integrity]] by linking columns.

## OVERVIEW:
Foreign [[keys]] are essential components in relational databases, used to maintain the [[integrity]] and consistency of [[data]]. They create a link between two tables by referencing a column or a set of columns in another table, known as the parent table. This relationship ensures that the [[data]] in the child table corresponds to valid entries in the parent table, preventing orphan records and maintaining referential [[integrity]]. Foreign [[keys]] can also enforce cascading actions, such as updates or deletions, to ensure that changes in the parent table are reflected in the child table. Proper use of foreign [[keys]] enhances [[data]] accuracy, simplifies complex queries, and supports the normalisation [[process]] in [[database]] design.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Foreign [[keys]] link columns between two tables.
2. They ensure referential [[integrity]] in databases.
3. Prevent orphan records in child tables.
4. Reference columns in a parent table.
5. Can enforce cascading updates and deletions.
6. Enhance [[data]] accuracy and consistency.
7. Simplify complex [[database]] queries.
8. Support [[database]] normalisation.
9. Essential for relational [[database]] design.
10. Improve overall [[database]] structure and reliability.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Foreign [[keys]] maintain [[data]] [[integrity]] by linking tables.
2. They prevent invalid [[data]] entries in child tables.
3. Cascading actions ensure synchronised updates and deletions.
4. Simplify the [[process]] of writing and managing queries.
5. Crucial for effective relational [[database]] management.
