## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Socket programming enables communication between devices over a network, allowing [[data]] exchange through established protocols.

## OVERVIEW:
Socket programming is a method used to enable communication between devices over a network. It involves creating a socket, which is an endpoint for sending and receiving [[data]]. Sockets can be used for various types of communication, including TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). TCP sockets provide reliable, connection-oriented communication, ensuring [[data]] is delivered in order and without errors. UDP sockets, on the other hand, offer connectionless communication, which is faster but does not guarantee delivery or order. Socket programming is fundamental for developing networked applications such as web servers, chat applications, and online games. It requires understanding of network protocols, IP addressing, and port numbers. [[Programming languages]] like [[Python]], [[Java]], and C++ offer libraries and APIs to facilitate socket programming. Mastery of socket programming involves handling multiple connections, managing [[data]] streams, and ensuring [[security]] through [[encryption]] and [[authentication]].
