# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Routing is the [[process]] of determining the best paths for [[data]] packets to travel across a network from source to destination.

# OVERVIEW:
Routing is a critical [[function]] in networking that involves selecting optimal paths for [[data]] packets to traverse from their origin to their destination across interconnected networks. This [[process]] is facilitated by routers, which are devices that analyze network topologies and make decisions based on routing tables and protocols. Routing protocols, such as RIP (Routing Information Protocol), [[OSPF]] (Open Shortest Path First), and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), provide the algorithms and rules necessary for routers to dynamically adjust to network changes and ensure efficient [[data]] delivery. Effective routing minimizes delays, maximizes bandwidth usage, and enhances the reliability of [[data]] transmission. It is essential for maintaining the performance and [[scalability]] of networks, whether they are small local area networks (LANs) or large-scale wide area networks (WANs) and [[the internet]]. Understanding routing is crucial for network administrators to manage and optimize network traffic effectively.
