# Subject description

Programming computers is an essential skill for computer scientists, software engineers, software developers and data
scientists, and successful programmers integrate many diverse capabilities to be able to solve complex, abstract
problems. This subject introduces the core programming concepts using an object-oriented approach to programming,
prioritising project-based learning and independent research, experimentation, and communication skills. Additionally,
most programming in industry occurs as alterations to a portion of a large existing codebase, and this subject
introduces students to how their initial programming explorations may eventually expand to making fixes or improvements
to complex industry-scale projects.

# Subject learning objectives (SLOs)

Upon successful completion of this subject students should be able to:

1. Apply basic programming concepts of [[state]], iteration, and [[decision]]. (D.1)

2. Solve computational problems by using abstract modelling and conceptualisation. (D.1)

3. Design and create simple functioning programs to achieve objectives. (C.1)

4. Interpret, describe, and document programs using clear communication. (E.1)

5. Reflect on programming decisions and formulate alternatives. (C.1)

# Course intended learning outcomes (CILOs)

This subject also contributes specifically to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (
CILOs):

Design Oriented: FEIT graduates apply problem solving, design and [[decision]]-making methodologies to develop components,
systems and [[processes]] to meet specified requirements. (C.1)

Technically Proficient: FEIT graduates apply abstraction, mathematics and discipline fundamentals, software, tools and
techniques to evaluate, implement and operate systems. (D.1)

Collaborative and Communicative: FEIT graduates work as an effective member or leader of diverse teams, communicating
effectively and operating within cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural contexts in the workplace. (E.1)

# Contribution to the development of graduate attributes

## Engineers Australia Stage 1 Competencies

This subject contributes to the development of the following Engineers Australia Stage 1 Competencies:

1.1. Comprehensive, theory based understanding of the underpinning natural and physical sciences and the engineering
fundamentals applicable to the engineering discipline.

1.2. Conceptual understanding of the mathematics, numerical analysis, statistics, and computer and information sciences
which underpin the engineering discipline.

2.1. Application of established engineering methods to complex engineering problem solving.

2.2. Fluent application of engineering techniques, tools and resources.

2.3. Application of systematic engineering synthesis and design [[processes]].

3.2. Effective oral and written communication in professional and lay domains.

# Teaching and learning strategies

This subject will employ several parallel learning structures to allow students to find a mixture of learning
experiences that suits their particular needs.

The flipped lecture format allows the students to engage with the learning material in an asynchronous, self-paced,
location-independent manner. It also supports a modular approach to delivering core content, permitting students to
revise, engage and re-engage as suits their needs. Included in the learning material are staged practice exercises to
[[help]] the students develop their knowledge and skills in a consequence- and stress-free environment.

In the workshops, this learning will be reinforced with scaffolded exercises that weave the core material together and
provide a practical experience of the subject matter. These exercises are then capped with a low-stakes assessment task
to [[help]] the students gauge their progress and understanding of the material.

Tying these two structural components together is the weekly drop-in sessions, that offer students a face-to-face expert
contact point tailored to their current progress, addressing the exact difficulties they are facing at the time.

The learning material also builds towards the larger, ongoing project, which ties the content together into a
functioning whole.

# Assessment: faculty procedures and advice

**Marking criteria**

Marking criteria for each assessment task will be available on the Learning Management
System: [Canvas](https://canvas.uts.edu.au/).

## Extensions

When, due to extenuating circumstances, you are unable to submit or present an assessment task on time, please contact
your subject coordinator before the assessment task is due to discuss an extension. Extensions may be granted up to a
maximum of 5 days (120 hours) for standard students or up to a maximum of 7 days (168 hours)
for [UTS Online students](https://www.uts.edu.au/utsonline-extension-form). In all cases you should have extensions
confirmed in writing.

## Special consideration

If you believe your performance in an assessment item or exam has been adversely affected by circumstances beyond your
control, such as a serious illness, loss or bereavement, hardship, trauma, or exceptional employment demands, you may be
eligible to apply
for [Special Consideration](http://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/managing-your-course/classes-and-assessment/special-circumstances/special).

## Late penalty

For Graded [[subjects]]:

Work submitted late without an approved extension is subject to a late penalty of 10 per cent of the total available
marks deducted per calendar day that the assessment is overdue (e.g. if an assignment is out of 40 marks, and is
submitted (up to) 24 hours after the deadline without an extension, the student will have four marks deducted from their
awarded mark). Work submitted after five calendar days is not accepted and a mark of zero is awarded.

For some assessment tasks a late penalty may not be appropriate – these are clearly indicated in the subject outline.
Such assessments receive a mark of zero if not completed by/on the specified date. Examples include:

a. weekly online tests or laboratory work worth a small proportion of the subject mark, or

b. online quizzes where answers are released to students on completion, or

c. professional assessment tasks, where the intention is to create an authentic assessment that has an absolute
submission date, or

d. take-[[home]] papers that are assessed during a defined time period, or

e. pass/fail assessment tasks.

For Pass/Fail [[subjects]]:

Work submitted late without an approved extension will only be assessed at the subject coordinator’s discretion.
Students who do not submit assessment tasks by the due dates may be referred to the Responsible Academic Officer
under [Student Rule 3.8.2](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/rules/uts-student-rules/section-3), and a fail
result may be recorded for the subject.

Request a review of a result

If you believe an error may have been made in the calculation of your result in an assessment task or the final result
for the subject, it is possible
to [request a review of a result](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/managing-your-course/classes-and-assessment/results/request-review-result)
with the Subject Coordinator within five (5) working days of the date of release of the result.

# [[Academic integrity]]

[[Academic integrity]] is about demonstrating honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility in your studies and
assessments. Studying at UTS and being part of our community means maintaining these values and acting with academic
integrity at all times. This is in line with expectations for professional practice
in [Engineering](https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/sites/default/files/2022-08/code-ethics-guidelines-professional-conduct-2022.pdf)
and [IT](https://www.acs.org.au/content/dam/acs/CodeOfProfessionalEthics_Mar_2023.pdf).

## Guide to practising [[academic integrity]]

As a UTS student, when you create something original, credit others and collaborate with care, you act with academic
integrity:

Create something original. This means doing all your own work from start to finish, submitting work that is original for
that assessment and being honest about any data or results.

Credit others. You need to acknowledge and reference the source of any ideas, data or materials you use or adapt in your
work.

Collaborate with care. Make sure you do group work according to the guidelines from your tutor, lecturer or supervisor,
study with your classmates and friends with care and keep your assessment and study notes just for you.

If you are feeling confused about [[academic integrity]], it’s okay, just ask! We are here to [[help]] you understand academic
integrity and do your assessments with confidence:

[Explore the guide to practising [[academic integrity]]](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/academic-support/academic-integrity),
including dos and don’ts.

[Get [[help]] with academic skills, such as writing, researching and referencing, and other support](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/academic-support/academic-integrity/academic-help)
for life outside of the classroom.

Talk to your tutor, lecturer, subject coordinator
or [UTS help services](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/academic-support/academic-integrity/academic-help)
if you are unsure about anything [[academic integrity]] related.

## Generative [[AI]] (GenAI) and [[academic integrity]]

In the Faculty of Engineering and IT [[subjects]], unless otherwise instructed by the Subject Coordinator, you are permitted
to use [[AI]] technologies, such as ChatGPT or DALL-E, to generate materials for background research and self-study. Only
assistive use is permitted. Content generated by [[AI]] technologies or other sources presented as your own work is
considered to be academic misconduct as per
the [UTS Student Rules on misconduct](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/rules/uts-student-rules/section-16).

There are a few things you must do to ensure you are maintaining [[academic integrity]]:

Check the rules for if and how you can use GenAI in your [[subjects]] and assessments via this subject outline or your
subject sites in Canvas (rules will differ between [[subjects]], so make sure you check each subject). If you are not sure,
check with your tutor, lecturer or subject coordinator.

Understand [how to use GenAI ethically](https://studyguides.lib.uts.edu.au/genai/home).

Unless instructed otherwise by the Subject
Coordinator, [reference and acknowledge](https://studyguides.lib.uts.edu.au/genai/referencing) the use of GenAI in your
work, providing details of the type of interactions and extent of usage.

## [[Academic integrity]] breaches

A breach of [[academic integrity]] is also known as 'academic misconduct'. A breach occurs if you engage in behaviour that
undermines [[academic integrity]], such as plagiarism and cheating (
see [Student Rule 16.2](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/rules/uts-student-rules/section-16)).

Plagiarism can take a number of forms including but not limited to:

copying any section of text, no matter how brief, from a book, journal, article or other written source, such as coding,
without duly acknowledging the source. copying any map, diagram, table or figure without duly acknowledging the source.
paraphrasing or otherwise using the ideas of another author without duly acknowledging the source.

re-using sections of verbatim text without using quote marks to indicate the text was copied from the source (even if a
reference is given).

Cheating includes, but is not limited to:

submitting work that is not your own, copying from another student, recycling another student's work, recycling
previously submitted work, and working with another student in the same cohort in a manner that exceeds the boundaries
of legitimate cooperation purchasing an assignment from a website and submitting it as original work. requesting or
paying someone else to write original work, such as an assignment, essay or computer program, and submitting it as
original work. manipulating an assessment to avoid the UTS detection software or using a third-party service to bypass
the UTS detection software. using material or equipment that is not specified on an examination paper for use in the
examination.

Students who allow their assessment to be copied, share their assessment on external platforms, or provide other
students with the answers to assessments are also subject to student misconduct Rules.

These are all serious forms of misconduct
and [penalties apply](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/academic-support/academic-integrity/consequences-plagiarism-and-cheating).

To [[help]] ensure [[academic integrity]], assessments that you submit electronically may be subject to similarity detection
software. Your work must be submitted in a format able to be assessed by the software (e.g. doc, pdf ([[text files]]), rtf,
html). Under
the [Coursework Assessments Policy](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/policies/uts-policy/coursework-assessments-policy) (
section 4.27), vivas or other invigilated tasks may be used to confirm or clarify your work and/or marks, and to verify
achievement of learning outcomes.

# Academic liaison officer

[Academic liaison officers](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/students-with-accessibility-requirements/accessibility-service/services-and-assistance/academic-liaison-officers-alos/alo-list) (
ALOs) are academic staff in each faculty who assist students experiencing difficulties in their studies due to:
disability and/or an ongoing health condition; carer responsibilities (e.g. being a primary carer for small children or
a family member with a disability); and pregnancy.

ALOs are responsible for approving adjustments to assessment arrangements for students in these categories. Students who
require adjustments due to disability and/or an ongoing health condition are requested to discuss their situation with
an accessibility consultant at
the [Accessibility Service](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/students-with-accessibility-requirements/accessibility-service)
before speaking to the relevant ALO.
