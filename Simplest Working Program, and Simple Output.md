# Simplest working program:
**For a [[programming language]] to be useful, you need:**
- [[State]]
- [[Branching]]
- [[Repetition]]
	- with these 3 things, you can write any program in the world. 
### ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:

### MAIN POINTS:
1. Simplest programs often consist of a single line that displays text to the screen.
2. [["Hello, World!"]] is a common first [[output]] in many programming tutorials.
3. Understanding a simple program requires basic knowledge of [[syntax]] and structure.
4. These programs serve as an introduction to the [[compilation]] or [[interpretation]] process.
5. [[Variables]] and [[data types]] can be introduced through slightly more complex examples.
6. [[Debugging]] skills begin with fixing errors in simple programs.
7. Each [[programming language]] has its unique way of writing a simple [[output]] program.
