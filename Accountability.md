## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Accountability in computer [[security]] ensures that actions and activities of users or systems can be traced and attributed to specific [[entities]] to maintain [[security]] and compliance.

## OVERVIEW:
Accountability in computer [[security]] is the principle that ensures all actions and activities within a system can be traced back to specific users or systems. This is crucial for maintaining [[security]], enforcing policies, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Accountability mechanisms typically involve logging and monitoring activities, maintaining audit trails, and implementing non-repudiation measures to prevent users from denying their actions. By ensuring that every action is attributable, organizations can detect and respond to [[security]] incidents more effectively, identify and address misuse or policy violations, and provide evidence in the event of legal or regulatory investigations. Accountability also fosters a culture of responsibility among users, as they are aware that their actions are being monitored and recorded. As cyber threats and regulatory demands evolve, maintaining robust accountability measures is essential for effective [[security]] management.
