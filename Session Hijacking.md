# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Session hijacking is a cyber attack where an attacker takes control of a user's session to gain unauthorized access to information or services.

# OVERVIEW:
Session hijacking is a [[security]] breach where an attacker exploits a valid computer session to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system. This attack typically occurs when a user is logged into a service, and the attacker takes over the session by stealing or predicting the session token. Session hijacking can occur through various methods, including [[cross-site scripting]], session fixation, and [[man]]-in-the-middle attacks. The consequences of session hijacking can be severe, leading to [[data]] breaches, identity theft, and financial loss. To mitigate these risks, organisations implement [[security]] measures such as using HTTPS, secure cookies, and session timeouts. Understanding the mechanisms and prevention strategies of session hijacking is crucial for maintaining the [[integrity]] and [[confidentiality]] of user [[data]].

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Session hijacking involves taking control of a user's active session.
2. Attackers exploit session tokens to gain unauthorized access.
3. Common methods include [[cross-site scripting]] and [[man]]-in-the-middle attacks.
4. Consequences include [[data]] breaches and identity theft.
5. HTTPS and secure cookies [[help]] prevent session hijacking.
6. Session fixation is a technique used in hijacking attacks.
7. Session timeouts can mitigate hijacking risks.
8. Attackers may predict or steal session tokens.
9. User [[data]] [[integrity]] is compromised during hijacking.
10. Organisations must implement robust [[security]] measures.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Session hijacking poses significant [[security]] risks.
2. Understanding attack methods is crucial for prevention.
3. Secure protocols like HTTPS are essential.
4. Regularly updating [[security]] measures is necessary.
5. User awareness can [[help]] prevent session hijacking.
