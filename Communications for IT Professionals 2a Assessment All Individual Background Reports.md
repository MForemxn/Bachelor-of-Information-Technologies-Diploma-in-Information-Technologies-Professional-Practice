## Design Area 1: Waste Management

## Project Opportunity 1.4: Waste as a resource

## Question: What are the current recycling and waste disposal practices of the Saibai Island? 

## Background

Saibai Island is situated between Australia and Papa New Guinea and is governed by the Torres Straight Islands Regional Council (TSIRC). According to the 2021 Australian census 338 people lived on Saibai, though according to residents the population is closer to 500 people (EWB, 2024). Like with its surrounding islands, Saibai faces the challenge of managing waste; both with recycling and general waste. On top of approximately 500 residents consistently contributing to domestic waste, there is also the industrial waste from businesses and waste from demolitions or constructions. With having this much waste there is a need to research what does Saibai currently have to manage their waste and their problems revolving around it and eventually discussing possible solutions.

## Existing Infrastructure

Saibai Island has a facility for waste disposal located at the east end of the island in which this waste depot has a build-up of waste that created a mound that buffers the waste, preventing it from reaching the mangroves (TSRA, n.d.). The current practice of waste disposal is for it to be “collected by a minipactor rubbish truck to be tipped on the ground and burnt, where possible” (TSRA, n.d., p. 119). In addition to having a waste depot, Saibai Island also exports to Cairns their “bulk waste such as cars, trucks, white goods & large metal objects” (TSRA, n.d, p. 119) for recycling.

According to Waterhouse et al (2013) all inhabited islands including Saibai use landfill as the main method for waste disposal. Hence the need to expand or find different solution to manage the waste, as eventually no room will be left in the landfills. Which is supported by the TSIRC (n.d.) as a problem that the existing waste facility are nearing capacity and is in need for solutions to be presented to fix this problem. It is also mentioned that “there is a lack of space on smaller islands” (Waterhouse et al, 2013, p. 15) as well as the condition of the surrounding land is unsatisfactory as it is either too steep, rocky or occupied by mangroves. The waste depot is also unable to be covered with soil due to the lack of the resource due to previous requests being unsuccessful (TSRA, n.d.).

## Effect of vehicles

Furthermore, vehicles are a big problem due to how they are disposed of. Currently they are with the landfill but take up a large amount of space which could be used for other waste. Vehicles that have reached the end of their life occupy large amounts of valuable space once broken down and is suggested to be transported off the island. As the space taken up by vehicles should be set aside for domestic waste. (TSRA, n.d.)

Quarantine also plays a huge role in the way Saibai Island handles recycling and waste disposal. This is due to the restriction placed that states that “any material transported between zones requires Australian Quarantine and Immigration Service clearance” (TSRA, n.d., p. 120). That means it requires for dirt to be removed from these old vehicles which could be a tedious process and not worth the cost. (TSRA, n.d.)

## Current [[Processes]]

Currently the “council provides a twice weekly garbage collection service using 120 litre wheelie bins for residential, while 240 litre bins are used for commercial purposes” (Parliament of Australia, n.d., p. 6). Approximately 5000t of waste is produced per year and accepted into the Thursday Island Waste Transfer Station (Parliament of Australia, n.d.). Though not all this waste comes from Saibai it is an indication of how the waste is collected and deposited. Recycling is not as advanced, and efforts are minimal in how it is managed. This is due to the strict quarantine requirements previously mentioned.  The Parliament of Australia’s report states that “Urgent Attention” is needed for this problem and sates the importance of “recycling and resource recovery” as a way to extend the landfills lifespan.

However, there were issues raised by the community involving the “banning of plastic bags”, “Disposal of end of life vehicles”, “recycling cardboard, aluminium, steel and glass”, “Proloning the life of the Horn Island Landfill”, “Cost of waste transport”, and “Quarantine Issues” (TSIRC, n.d.). These could be key areas to research for the project opportunity, waste as a resource.

## What have the Torres Strait Islands done to deal with their waste that enhances their communities both economically and environmentally?

**Design Area: Waste Management, 1.4 – Waste as a Resource**

## Background

Saibai Island are facing many challenges with their waste management due to the lack of land available to them, producing worsened environmental and sustainability challenges. The Torres Strait Island Regional Council are bringing forward many priority issues to address including waste management which highlights the lack of space and resources on the Torres Strait Islands in dealing with the increasing amount of waste (Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2016b). A specific area set aside for waste disposal would allow for more opportunities including jobs and a reduction of pollution, further enhancing the Saibai community (EWB Australia, 2022). 

## Origins of Waste

As of 2016, the TSIRC have begun “trialling recycling on Warraber” (Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2016a), an island approximately 90km South of Saibai. This trial has “provided some key insights” (Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2016a), into the successes that recycling can potentially have on the ongoing issue that waste is for the communities on Saibai Island. On average a person from the Torres Strait region generates 430kg of waste, with 60% of this waste being recyclable or decomposable waste (Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2016a). Due to this high percentage of waste being environmentally friendly to dispose of the increased importance of creating recycling and composting facilities on Saibai and other Torres Strait Island has become essential to improving the current waste management solution. This will have lasting effects on Saibai’s environmental [[state]] as the reduced amount of landfill will prevent possible contamination of water or food sources through the soil. An economic benefit provided by recycling is that the Saibai Island communities can use this recycled material to create different structures such as piers or buildings, allowing the community to reduce the cost of building such structures.

## Current Methods

Current methods utilised by the TSIRC to dispose of the increasing amount of waste in the landfills on the Torres Strait Islands is by incineration (Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2016a). “The TSIRC recently applied for $380,000 in funding through the Maturing the Infrastructure Pipeline Program 2 Funding Program” (Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2016a), allowing for more islands in the Torres Strait region to receive an incinerator to [[help]] reduce the increasing amount of waste. This method is more focussed on smaller islands as they have less land available to create new landfill sites. One downfall with this current method is the air pollution created by the incinerators. This causes many potential problems in the future as the atmosphere traps in heat due to the dense Co2, forcing the sea level to rise eventually reducing the Torres Strait Islands land size. This also effects the communities and governments greatly as they must expend resources and money on the maintenance and operation of the incinerator whilst not allowing the waste to be used as resource for infrastructure around the island.

## Benefits of Waste Reduction

To allow for the Saibai Island communities to participate in the reduction of waste on the Island provides economic benefits but environmental benefits too. The economic benefit is that by providing members of the community with jobs at these recycling or waste facilities they will provide the people with a steady income from the government run facilities (Queensland Government, 2017). This allows for the families to be given a more stable income which can [[help]] massively with supplying food, water, shelter, and resources for the children’s learning. The introduction of this new source of money allows the Saibai community to enhance their livelihood, providing more growth and hope for the community to progress and allow their future generations to go study abroad. The environmental benefits of creating recycling or waste facilities are the reduction of pollution into the air, water, and soil. This allows the Saibai community to gain access to better quality food and water, decreasing the health risks associated with drinking or eating contaminated food or water.

## Goals

The Queensland Governments partnership with the TSIRC have produced many goals for the Torres Strait Region, including Saibai Island. By 2050, they aim to reduce the amount of household waste by 25% and preventing 90% of waste from going to landfill (Queensland Government, 2021). If achieved these goals will greatly improve the communities of Saibai Island both environmentally by the conditions of the island but also the economic opportunities provided by the jobs created and reduced cost of building structures with this recycled material.

## Origins

Design Area and Project Opportunity: Waste Management, 1.4 Waste as a Resource

Student Name: Solomon Pager

Student ID: 25255213

Saibai Island is located in the Torres Strait of Queensland Australia. It is positioned north of Australia’s mainland and is managed within the Torres Strait Island Region local government area. Saibai Island has a total population of 340 people (ABS 2021), most of which live in the town of Saibai on the north-west coast of the island.

##  Impact

In recent years, waste management has become a crucial problem for Saibai Island and its community. Waste disposal is pivotal for the sustainability and well-being of the island and its inhabitants as if sustainable waste practices are not maintained it can result in several negative social, environmental and economic impacts.

Saibai Island currently has one waste depot on the eastern side of the island. Waste management has become an issue for the Saibai community due to limited land, resources and equipment on the island. In its current situation, the Saibai community do their best to reuse and recycle waste where possible. The Torres Strait Island Regional Council’s local plan code on Saibai Island states “waste materials are reused or recycled, wherever possible, to minimise reliance on local waste facilities”.

##  Waste as a resource

Waste as a resource explores recycling common forms of waste found on Saibai and repurposing them. It also includes many challenges accompanied with the process. To accomplish the overall goal of creating a sustainable, eco-friendly system we must first understand the cause and origin of this waste. This can allow us to estimate future waste predictions, resources and materials.

##  Recent Efforts

In October 2019 the Australian marine debris initiative carried out a beach clean-up on multiple islands of the Torres Strait. The Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA) invited the Tangaroa blue team to [[help]] clean up Federal beach on Horn Island and beaches on Badu Island to carry out their study.

After arriving on Horn Island (located 138km south of Saibai Island) in the hour of work, the team managed to collect 13kg worth of rubbish off the 590m beach. The rubbish included over 300 cigarette butts filled with plastic fibres. These butts can take up to 10 years to break up and biodegrade. Most of this rubbish was from local sources.

##  Other Efforts

Following this, Tangaroa blue team visited Badu Island, which is only 100km SSW of Sabai. The team got to work and after sorting and counting the debris on the islands south coast results displayed 226kg of rubbish. It was made up of a combination of soft plastic food packaging, cigarette butts, glass and cut timber. It is believed most of the litter originated from local sources however the team was informed by rangers that large amounts of rubbish on the northern beaches originated from international sources.

##  Sources of Waste

Another large source of waste on Saibai involves The Saibai community’s diet. While this does consist of locally sourced fruits and vegetables, there is a heavy reliance on packaged and processed foods imported from mainland Australia or nearby regions. This is evident in a 2018 study conducted by HealthBulletin which stated, “The nutrition burden among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults is underscored by malnutrition”. Malnutrition includes both under-nutrition and over-nutrition, caused by over-consumption of unhealthy ‘discretionary’ foods. These foods packaging as well as plastic bags and disposable cutlery are made up of single use plastics which are a large contributor to the islands waste due to the extensive time it takes them to break down.

The existing waste facility as well as sewage and water supply infrastructure are nearing capacity, meaning action must be taken soon or this problem could spiral out of control. Effective waste management is essential to preserve the well-being of Saibai Islands community and inhabitants.

##  Effects of Inadequate Waste Management

Inadequate waste management can inflict the social impacts of poor health risks and quality of life. Incorrect waste disposal can lead to health risks in the community including the spread of diseases through the islands water sources. It can also significantly impact the quality of life.

Similarly, the environment can be largely affected through the management of waste. A substantial part through marine pollution on the island. Economic impacts include tourism impacts, the cost of managing the waste and in future, the cost of reusing and recycling.

##  Conclusions

After understanding the impacts, it’s clear effective waste management is not only environmentally responsible but economically beneficial for the Island. A study conducted by K.E. Parnell, S.G. Smithers and L. Ischenko in 2010 reported an estimate of $499,000 required for the necessary waste and landfill facilities on Saibai Island. They also elaborated on approaches used at the facilities. These include waste being collected by the council rubbish truck and burnt on-site. Additionally, they explain a bund wall has been constructed surrounding the facility to protect it from flooding. 

Thus, waste management on Saibai Island is essential to address for the community. By understanding the origins and types of waste and considering the social, environmental and economic factors, Saibai can become a sustainable and eco-friendly ecosystem.

## Introduction

Situated just four kilometers south of the Papua New Guinea mainland, Saibai Island serves as a living bridge between the ancient and the modern, showcasing the enduring legacy of its indigenous people amidst the challenges of the 21st century, such as climate change (QLD, 2024). This research paper will take a look into the social structure and culture of the Saibai community, along with the contemporary challenges that they are facing so that we can have a better understanding of their needs.

## Indigenous people and culture

The indigenous inhabitants of Saibai Island are mostly Torres Strait Islanders (ABS, 2021), a group with a distinct cultural identity, language, and traditions that differ significantly from those of mainland Aboriginal Australians. The cultural fabric of Saibai Island is woven from centuries-old traditions with a deep connection to the land, the sea, and the spiritual world, reflecting a unique blend of Melanesian and Australian Indigenous influences (QLD, 2024).

On Saibai, people use KKY (Kalaw Kawaw Ya) as their main language in daily activities. For the people of Saibai, passing knowledge and cultural values to future generations is a crucial mission that everyone must carry. To this end, KKY not only preserves the cultural heritage of Saibai through myths and historical stories but also fosters the solidarity and well-being of its residents (EWB, 2024).

The people of Saibai Island possess profound knowledge of their natural environment, a result of centuries of interaction with their surroundings. This knowledge encompasses an understanding of tidal patterns, seasonal changes, and the habitats of various plant and animal species, which helps them in fishing, hunting, and foraging practices. Land and sea are not merely part of their surroundings but are crucial to the Islanders' cultural identity and spirituality (EWB, 2024). This deep connection between nature and Saibai Islanders has been used as a great source of inspiration for their creative sculptures and printing (TSIRC, 2024; Cairns Art Gallery, 2019; Yarn, n.d.). Saibai Islanders also maintain their cultural identity through dance and music. Traditional dances and songs are performed during community ceremonies and pivotal life events such as births, marriages, and funerals. Throughout history, upon the arrival of the London Missionary Society, they have also adopted the Christian rituals adopted Christian rituals and ceremonies while upholding their traditional values (Scheu, 2021)ML1(#_msocom_1) .

## Social Structure and Leadership ML2(#_msocom_2) 

By upholding the clan system, Saibaians maintain a form of belonging that is both flexible and deeply rooted in shared cultural symbols and narratives. To them, clans are not just groups of families but also means for the expression and preservation of unique cultural and social identities. At the same time, this loose conglomerate structure allows for individual families within the clan to maintain their independence, particularly in politics and land ownership (Davis, 2008 p.22). In terms of spirituality and cultural preservation, elders and cultural leaders hold the responsibility of guiding the community and the most respect and authority.

The project, therefore, should respect and leverage existing social structures and leadership systems. Engaging with elders and community leaders in the planning and implementation phases can facilitate community buy-in and ensure that the project aligns with local governance. Family and clan structures can also be integral in promoting recycling practices through community networks.

## Contemporary challengesML3(#_msocom_3) 

Saibai Island is currently facing dire climate change challenges that threaten its very existence and cultural heritage spanning over 65,000 years. The island's low-lying geography makes it particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels, leading to increased erosion and the intrusion of salt into the soil, which devastates local vegetation and undermines traditional farming practices (Jenkins, 2022). As a result, the reliance on cargo ships for essential supplies has surged, significantly increasing living costs for the island's residents. The exacerbation of climate change is not only a threat to infrastructure but also the social fabric of the community, as it endangers the continuity of cultural practices and traditions. This environmental crisis has escalated to the point where the community's cemetery has seen graves eroded by water. Despite the significant $24.5 million investment from the government, the seawall completed in 2017 has fallen short of expectations (Wellauer, 2023).

## Conclusion

As we contemplate the future of Saibai Island in the face of these environmental challenges, the need for innovative, culturally sensitive, and sustainable solutions becomes ever more apparent. This research sets the stage for the subsequent [[design process]] of my team’s waste recycling project tailored to the unique needs and circumstances of Saibai Island. By leveraging the community's existing social structures, knowledge systems, and leadership, the project should aim not only to address the immediate environmental concerns but also to contribute to the long-term sustainability of the island. In doing so, we hope to honor and preserve the rich cultural legacy of Saibai Island for future generations, ensuring that their heritage continues to thrive alongside the global efforts to combat climate change.

## Origins of Waste within Remote Pacific Islands

How can we effectively determine the different sources of waste on pacific islands such as Saibai, and how can we best adjust the flow of waste through communities to divert waste away from landfill?

## Context

In order to fully understand the origins of waste on pacific islands, especially Saibai island, we first need to understand the context and challenges of proper waste management in remote areas, including, but not limited to, specific challenges associated with centralised waste collection and disposal, and the role geographic isolation plays in waste management practices and options.

## Geographic Isolation

The geographic isolation of Saibai island and the lack of a developed economy means that there is a distinct lack of transportation infrastructure, resulting in the movement of waste being a costly and difficult endeavour. "...the logistics required to remove waste from the island and transport it to recycling/disposal facilities on the mainland can be extremely costly in their current form." (EWB Challenge, 2024) This is why, frequently, waste created is unlikely to end up far from the specific community which created it. This, coupled with the limited financial resources and lack of manpower in remote communities, proves many common solutions to waste management to be impractical on Saibai island.

The need for effective, centralised waste management becomes evermore dire when the consequences of ineffective waste management are analysed, such as climate vulnerability, health risks, and technological limitations.

## Natural Disasters

According to the Torres Strait Island Planning Council, "... Saibai Island is currently subject to frequent inundation over parts of the community during highest tides. The extent and frequency of these events are likely to increase in the future with climate change... most of the larger vegetated areas are identified as a potential bushfire risk" (Torres Strait Island Planning Council, 2012). As such, the improper removal of waste could prove an environmental threat to the island of Saibai, with a natural disaster carrying the potential of contaminating the land with various forms of disease from the waste. These diseases could further spread to the population, causing sickness in the people of the island.

It has been established that traditional means of waste management are not able to be implemented on Saibai island, so the job of researchers shift from determining how to effectively mimic western, developed waste management into designing custom solutions which are more likely to work specifically on small pacific island nations. This most often includes upcycling, which is a technique used to breathe new value into a product by transforming waste into art, furniture, or accessories. This, when combined with recycling, provides a good foundation to deal with a significant portion of waste on Saibai Island.

## Types of Waste

Some of the forms of most common forms of waste found on the land of pacific island nations are ‘Ghost Nets’ and microplastics, which quite often wash up on the shores of these nations, exasperating their waste management problems creating significantly more waste for the people of Saibai to manage.

Discarded fishing nets (often referred to as ‘Ghost Nets’) are discarded by fishers both in the local area, and the greater Pacific Ocean, which are carried by currents end up washed onto shores of islands such as Saibai. These nets have the potential of entangling natural sea life and causing a threat to the diversity of the environment. The people of Mystery Island have shown that these can be upcycled into material for creating artistic sculptures, baskets or mats, recycled into nylon pellets for the manufacturing of clothing, used in construction projects to reinforce concrete, and used to create eco-friendly and ‘green’ building materials.

The same can be said for microplastics which end up on the shores of Saibai. Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic which end up in the ocean, and break down very slowly into smaller pieces of plastics. These microplastics are hazardous to marine flora and fauna. Research has shown that these can be repurposed into new plastic products, transformed into fuel for machines and motor vehicles, and used as materials in local manufacturing or craft.

## Government Regulations

Another concern threatening the Saibai island is policies and regulations from government agencies. "Torres Strait has special biosecurity requirements for the southward movement of the following products between the Torres Strait Protected Zone to the Torres Strait Permanent Biosecurity Monitoring Zone, and any Torres Strait islands to mainland Australia. These high risk goods can only be moved if a permit is granted by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry" (Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, 2015.) Further, there are numerous changes needed to support recycling and upcycling. These include; policy alignment and integration, financial incentives and subsidies, capacity building and technical assistance, public awareness and education, stakeholder engagement and collaboration.

In conclusion, by identifying the sources of waste into a community, we can more effectively divert this waste away from landfill in developed countries, and by isolating specific sources, useful repurposing of this waste can be a more suitable alternative to traditional waste management in western countries.

**_Which forms of waste can be used as resources on Saibai Island?_**

Saibai Island is located in the northwestern Torres Strait, around 140 kilometres from the northern tip of Cape York, Queensland (Australian Government, n.d). Saibai island grapples with complicated waste management challenges due to constraints such as limited space, strict biosecurity regulations, and environmental considerations (EWB, 2024). The limitations of a centralized waste collection and disposal area located south of the community spark an exploration into reducing, reusing, and recycling waste (EWB, 2024). Design Area 1.4 focuses extensively on the creation of useful resources from various forms of waste, particularly addressing the issues of ghost nets and plastics that frequently wash up on Saibai island’s shores. By transforming common waste forms on the island into valuable resources, such as repurposing ghost nets and plastics, Saibai can adapt a more environmentally conscious and resilient waste management approach, fostering a positive impact on the community and the island's delicate ecosystem.

**Forms of waste on Saibai Island**

Saibai Island is [[home]] to a variety of waste forms, ranging from household items, solid waste, ghost nets, and plastic debris that can often be found on island’s shores (EWB, 2024). Although the Saibai community might view these materials and forms of waste as discarded and useless, there is definite potential to clean and repurpose items such as plastic and ghost nets, transforming them into reusable resources that can contribute to the island's sustainability. Repurposing ghost nets can play a crucial role in addressing waste management issues on Saibai island, as they pose a threat to coastal plant and animal communities, particularly nesting species like turtles. Thus why it is crucial to have these ghost nets removed from the shores and ocean, as it not only addresses the issue of marine debris but also promotes resourcefulness and sustainability within the community on Saibai Island (Park Australia, 2021).

**Ghost Nets as a resource**

According to the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation), several projects focusing on the elimination of ghost nets have been operational since the early 2000’s and have extended to include the Torres Strait region (Britta Denise Hardesty et.al, 2021). Local ranger groups in the Torres Strait region have documented and eliminated thousands of nets, specifically 15,000 ghost nets as of 2015 in the region, leading to many positive impacts such as acquiring new livelihood skills, transforming ghost nets into artwork, and enhancing mental health and well-being (Britta Denise Hardesty et.al, 2021). Ghost nets can also be recycled and repurposed for artistic uses, such as creating sculptures or traditional crafts, promoting cultural expression, and reducing marine debris on the island. Ghost nets being a prevalent form of waste on the island, can as well be repurposed as valuable resources through mechanical recycling technologies, including pretreatment and preprocessing. The shredded polymer recyclate generated from these [[processes]] can be utilized for various purposes, such as creating beneficial and useful resources like mats, baskets, or other locally needed products (Skidmore MA et.al, 2023). This approach not only addresses the issue of marine debris but also provides sustainable solutions and economic benefits to the community on Saibai Island (Skidmore MA et.al, 2023).

**Plastic as a resource**

Recycling plastic debris, particularly plastic bottles, is an effective strategy to get rid of and make the most use of one of the most common forms of waste on the island. To encourage this, a Container Refund Scheme has been put into place, offering a 10-cent refund for each container, commencing in Queensland, which will also be considered for the Torres Strait Islands (TSIRC, 2016). This not only promotes recycling but also presents an opportunity for the community of Saibai to economically benefit from collecting and returning plastic bottles. A further effective strategy for transforming waste into resources is to upcycle products and reusable forms of waste. By encouraging the use of plastic waste to create upcycled resources, local artists and entrepreneurs on the island can explore the production of sustainable items such as clothing, bags, and accessories made from recycled plastic materials. This not only reduces the demand for new materials but also promotes a circular economy within the Saibai community, enabling the people of Saibai Island to think twice before throwing away certain plastic materials as they may be upcycled for a greater purpose.

Saibai Island's intricate waste management challenges necessitate customized strategies. By implementing the practice of reducing, reusing, and recycling, followed by the repurposing of ghost nets and plastics, the island can transform its waste into valuable resources, significantly enhancing the island’s economy and sustainability. Resources such as bags, clothing, and accessories created from Saibai’s waste will be a key influence in harnessing the island’s sustainable future.

They pay a lot of respect into land and sea, so take that into consideration if we do something with the land or sea. ML1(#_msoanchor_1)

The remaining part may suggest creating artworks from plastic, fish net, etc.. or instruments for ceremonies?

Focus on the last part of this section, as we can leverage the clan structure to implement our solutions into groups of families ML2(#_msoanchor_2)

Basically, they are currently having climate change problems: erosion, soil salinity => affecting local vegetation, rising sea levels and built seawalls don't work effectively. ML3(#_msoanchor_3)

Idea: Recycle sort of "box" so that they can plant vegetable?
