A network is a connecting system (wireline or wireless) that permits different computers to share resources.
# Example
- one key example of procedures in information systems is the difference in [[feedback]] systems from Uber Eats and Uber Ridesharing
	- Uber eats prompts the user for [[feedback]] about 15-20 mins after the delivery, allowing for the user to consume the food before asking for their [[feedback]]
	- Uber ridesharing, however, prompts the user immediately after exiting the vehicle, as that is when the [[feedback]] is likely to be the most accurate.
