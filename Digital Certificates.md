# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Digital certificates authenticate identities online by linking public [[keys]] to individuals or [[entities]], ensuring secure communications and transactions.

# OVERVIEW:
Digital certificates are electronic documents used to verify the identity of individuals, organisations, or devices in online communications. They are issued by trusted [[entities]] known as Certificate Authorities (CAs) and contain information such as the certificate holder's public key, the CA's digital signature, and the certificate's validity period. Digital certificates play a crucial role in establishing trust in digital environments by ensuring that the public key contained within the certificate belongs to the entity it claims to represent. They are fundamental to secure web browsing, email [[encryption]], and other secure communications protocols. By providing a way to authenticate identities and encrypt [[data]], digital certificates [[help]] prevent [[man]]-in-the-middle attacks and other [[security]] threats. The most common type of digital certificate is the SSL/TLS certificate, used to secure websites and enable HTTPS connections.
