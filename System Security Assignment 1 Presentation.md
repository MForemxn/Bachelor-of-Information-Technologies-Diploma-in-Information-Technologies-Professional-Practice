##  **[Introduction – 45 seconds]** 
“Good [morning/afternoon] everyone. My name is Mason Foreman, and today I’ll be discussing the latest advancements in deepfake detection methods. As deepfake technology becomes more sophisticated, it poses significant risks, from misinformation to financial fraud. This presentation will explore how deepfakes are created, how we can detect them, and the challenges faced in combating them.”

## **[Slide 2: How Deepfakes Are Created – 50 seconds]** 
“Deepfakes are generated using artificial intelligence, particularly through Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs. This process involves two neural networks—one creating the fake content and the other attempting to detect it. Over time, these models improve, producing highly realistic videos where a person can be made to say or do things they never did. These deepfakes can be categorized into face synthesis, face swapping, and lip-syncing, each presenting unique challenges for detection.”

## **[Slide 3: Image-Based Detection Methods – 50 seconds]** 
“Detecting deepfake images often involves using Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs, which analyze inconsistencies in facial structures and textures. Research has shown that current CNN-based techniques can achieve detection rates ranging from 74% to 96%. One key approach is identifying artifacts like unnatural lighting, irregular eye reflections, and inconsistent skin textures. Some advanced models even use hybrid CNN-LSTM techniques, which have significantly improved accuracy in detecting synthetic content.”

## **[Slide 4: Video-Based Detection Methods – 50 seconds]** 
“Unlike images, deepfake videos pose an additional challenge—consistency across frames. Detection methods rely on analyzing temporal inconsistencies, such as unnatural blinking patterns or mismatched lip movements. One effective approach is combining CNN models with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which track these inconsistencies over time. Current detection accuracy for video deepfakes ranges from 67% to 94%, with better results when spatial and temporal features are analyzed together.”

## **[Slide 5: Challenges in Deepfake Detection – 50 seconds]** 
“Despite advancements, deepfake detection still faces major challenges. First, models trained on one dataset often struggle when applied to new deepfake techniques, making generalization a persistent issue. Second, video compression on social media reduces detection accuracy by up to 30%, as subtle artifacts are lost. Lastly, ethical concerns arise regarding privacy and the legal implications of detecting and regulating deepfake content.”

## **[Slide 6: Emerging Trends & Future Research – 50 seconds]** 
“To improve detection, researchers are exploring hybrid human-AI models, which combine human intuition with machine learning algorithms to enhance accuracy. Transfer learning, a technique where pre-trained models adapt to new deepfake variations, is another promising avenue. Additionally, super-resolution techniques, which enhance video quality before analysis, have been shown to improve detection rates by up to 15% for heavily compressed media.”

## **[Conclusion – 50 seconds]** 
“In conclusion, deepfake technology is evolving rapidly, making robust detection methods more critical than ever. AI-driven models, particularly CNNs and LSTM networks, have proven effective, but challenges remain in generalizing detection across diverse datasets and combating compressed media. Moving forward, collaboration between AI researchers, policymakers, and the public will be essential to maintain trust in digital media. Thank you for your time—I’m happy to answer any questions.”
