**GNOME** ([/ɡəˈnoʊm, ˈnoʊm/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English")),[9][10][11] originally an acronym for **GNU Network Object Model Environment**,[12] is a [free and open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software "Free and open-source software") [desktop environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment "Desktop environment")for [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux") and other [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like "Unix-like")[13] [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system").

Many major [Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution "Linux distribution"), including [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian "Debian"), [Fedora Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_Linux "Fedora Linux"), [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu "Ubuntu"), [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux "Red Hat Enterprise Linux"), and [SUSE Linux Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUSE_Linux_Enterprise "SUSE Linux Enterprise") distribute GNOME as their default desktop environment; it is also the default in [Oracle Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Solaris "Oracle Solaris"), a [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix "Unix") operating system.

GNOME is developed by the [GNOME Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Project "GNOME Project"), which is composed of both volunteers and paid contributors, the largest corporate contributor being [Red Hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat "Red Hat").[14][15][16] It is an international project that aims to develop [frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework "Software framework") for software development, to program end-user applications based on these frameworks, and to coordinate efforts for the [internationalization, localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization "Internationalization and localization"), and [accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility "Accessibility") of that software.

### GNOME 1

Main article: [GNOME 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_1 "GNOME 1")

GNOME was started on 15 August 1997[12] by [Miguel de Icaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Icaza "Miguel de Icaza") and [Federico Mena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Mena "Federico Mena") [[es](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Mena "es:Federico Mena")] as a [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software "Free software") project to develop a [desktop environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment "Desktop environment") and [applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software "Application software") for it.[17] It was founded in part because the [K Desktop Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_Desktop_Environment_1 "K Desktop Environment 1"), which was growing in popularity, relied on the [Qt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software) "Qt (software)") [widget toolkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_toolkit "Widget toolkit") which used a [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software "Proprietary software") license until version 2.0 (June 1999).[18][19] In place of Qt, [GTK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK "GTK") (GNOME Toolkit, at that time called GIMP Toolkit) was chosen as the base of GNOME. GTK is licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License "GNU Lesser General Public License")(LGPL), a free software license that allows software linking to it to use a much wider set of licenses, including proprietary software licenses.[20] GNOME itself is licensed under the LGPL for its libraries and the [GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License "GNU General Public License")(GPL) for its applications.[21]

GNOME was formerly a part of the [GNU Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project "GNU Project"),[17][22][23][24] but that is no longer the case. In 2021, GNOME Executive Director Neil McGovern publicly tweeted that GNOME was not a GNU project and that he had been asking GNU to remove GNOME from their list of packages since 2019.[25][26] In 2021, GNOME was removed from the list.[27] GNOME proceeded to remove mentions of any link to GNU from their code and documentation.[28] The name "GNOME" was initially an acronym for _GNU Network Object Model Environment_, referring to the original intention of creating a [distributed object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_object "Distributed object") framework similar to [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft")'s [OLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Linking_and_Embedding "Object Linking and Embedding"),[29][30] but the acronym was eventually dropped because it no longer reflected the vision of the GNOME project.[30]

The California startup [Eazel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eazel "Eazel") developed the [Nautilus file manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus_(file_manager) "Nautilus (file manager)") from 1999 to 2001. De Icaza and [Nat Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Friedman "Nat Friedman") founded Helix Code (later [Ximian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ximian "Ximian")) in 1999 in Massachusetts; this company developed GNOME's infrastructure and applications and was purchased by [Novell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell "Novell") in 2003.

During the transition to GNOME 2 and shortly thereafter, there were brief talks about creating a _GNOME Office_ suite.[31][32] On 15 September 2003 GNOME-Office 1.0, consisting of [AbiWord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AbiWord "AbiWord") 2.0, [GNOME-DB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME-DB "GNOME-DB") 1.0, and [Gnumeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnumeric "Gnumeric") 1.2.0, was released.[33][34][35] Although some release planning for GNOME Office 1.2 was happening on the gnome-office mailing list,[36][37][38] and Gnumeric 1.4 was announced as a part of it,[39] the 1.2 release of the suite itself never materialized. As of 4 May 2014, the GNOME wiki only mentions "GNOME/GTK applications that are useful in an office environment".[40]

### GNOME 2

Main article: [GNOME 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_2 "GNOME 2")

GNOME 2 was released in June 2002[41][42] and was very similar to a conventional desktop interface, featuring a simple desktop in which users could interact with virtual objects such as windows, icons, and files. GNOME 2 started out with [Sawfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawfish_(window_manager) "Sawfish (window manager)") as its default [window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager "Window manager"), but later switched to [Metacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacity "Metacity") in GNOME 2.2.[43][44] The handling of windows, applications, and files in GNOME 2 is similar to that of contemporary desktop [[operating systems]]. In the default configuration of GNOME 2, the desktop has a launcher menu for quick access to installed programs and file locations; open windows may be accessed by a taskbar along the bottom of the screen; and the top-right corner features a notification area for programs to display notices while running in the background. However, these features can be moved to almost any position or orientation the user desires, replaced with other functions, or removed altogether.

As of 2009, GNOME 2 was the default desktop for [OpenSolaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSolaris "OpenSolaris").[45] The [MATE desktop environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATE_(software) "MATE (software)") is a fork of the GNOME 2 codebase (see Criticism, below.)

### GNOME 3

Main article: [GNOME 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_3 "GNOME 3")

In 2008, an increasing discontent among the community and developers about the lack of project direction and technical progress prompted the announcement of GNOME 3.0. Originally, the plan was to make only incremental changes and avoid disruption for users.[46] This changed when efforts led to the creation of the [GNOME Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Shell "GNOME Shell").[47]

GNOME 3 was released in 2011.[48] While GNOME 1 and 2 interfaces followed the traditional [desktop metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_metaphor "Desktop metaphor"), the GNOME Shell adopted a more abstract metaphor with a streamlined window management workflow, where switching between different tasks and [virtual desktops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_desktop "Virtual desktop") occurs in a separate area called _the_ _overview._[47] The _Minimize_ and _maximize_ buttons were hidden by default, leaving only the close button and application name in the [window decoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_decoration "Window decoration").[49][50]

GNOME 3 brought many enhancements to core software.[47] Many [GNOME Core Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Core_Applications "GNOME Core Applications") also went through redesigns to provide a better user experience.[51][52] [Mutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutter_(software) "Mutter (software)") replaced [Metacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacity "Metacity") as the default window manager[53][54] and [Adwaita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adwaita_(design_language) "Adwaita (design language)")replaced [Clearlooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearlooks "Clearlooks") as the default theme.[55]

#### Criticism

The release of GNOME 3 caused considerable controversy in the [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU "GNU") and [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux")communities.[56] Aiming to provide an easy-to-use and uncluttered user experience has led to some criticized design decisions, like the removal of _minimize_ and _maximize_ buttons, the simplification of configuration options, and visual clues that could lead to confusion.[47]

A few projects have been initiated to continue development of GNOME 2.x or to modify GNOME 3.x to be more like the 2.x releases:

- The [MATE desktop environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATE_desktop_environment "MATE desktop environment") was [forked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development) "Fork (software development)") from the GNOME 2 code base with the intent of retaining the traditional GNOME 2 interface whilst keeping compatibility with modern Linux technology, such as [GTK 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK "GTK").[57][58]
- The [Linux Mint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Mint "Linux Mint") team addressed the issue by developing "Mint GNOME Shell Extensions" that ran on top of GNOME Shell and allowed it to be used via the traditional desktop metaphor. This eventually led to the creation of the [Cinnamon desktop environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_(desktop_environment) "Cinnamon (desktop environment)"), which was forked from the GNOME 3 codebase.[59]
- The [LXDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXDE "LXDE") Project, which was experimenting with a [Qt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software) "Qt (software)") port at the time,[60]joined the [Razor-qt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor-qt "Razor-qt") Team and became [LXQt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXQt "LXQt").[61]
- [Canonical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_(company) "Canonical (company)"), the company developing Ubuntu, ceased working with the GNOME Shell developers during the GNOME 3 planning phases[62][63][64]and released their own shell, [Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(user_interface) "Unity (user interface)"), replacing GNOME as the default desktop shell in [Ubuntu 11.04 "Natty Narwhal"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_11.04 "Ubuntu 11.04") released in April 2011.[65]Previously, Unity had only been intended for use with the [Ubuntu Netbook Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Netbook_Edition "Ubuntu Netbook Edition") starting with version 10.10 and a now-canceled edition of Ubuntu called Ubuntu Light.[66] However, Ubuntu has since switched to a modified version of GNOME as of Ubuntu 17.10.[67]

Among those critical of the early releases of GNOME 3 is [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds "Linus Torvalds"), the creator of the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel "Linux kernel"). Torvalds abandoned GNOME for a while after the release of GNOME 3.0, saying, "The developers have apparently decided that it's 'too complicated' to actually do real work on your desktop, and have decided to make it really annoying to do". He then switched to [Xfce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce "Xfce").[68]

Over time, critical reception has grown more positive. In 2013, Torvalds resumed using GNOME, noting that "they have extensions now that are still much too hard to find; but with extensions you can make your desktop look almost as good as it used to look two years ago".[69][70] [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian "Debian"), a Linux distribution that had historically used GNOME 2, switched to [Xfce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce "Xfce") when GNOME 3 was released, but re-adopted GNOME 3 in time for the release of Debian 8 "Jessie".[71] Ubuntu switched from Unity to GNOME 3 with several extensions to resemble Unity, such as a persistent left application panel instead of a hidden dock and re-enabling desktop icons, with [Ubuntu 17.10 Artful Aardvark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_17.10_Artful_Aardvark "Ubuntu 17.10 Artful Aardvark") in 2017. This release also saw the [Ubuntu GNOME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_GNOME "Ubuntu GNOME") edition merge with the mainline release.[72]However, [Ubuntu Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Unity "Ubuntu Unity") was then released, keeping the Unity desktop and continuing to update it.

### GNOME 40 and higher

GNOME 40 was released on 24 March 2021.[73][74] It immediately follows version 3, but adopts a new [versioning scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning "Software versioning") and a schedule of future major releases on a fixed six-month cycle (see Release Cycle).[75] With this quicker release cadence, major releases became somewhat leaner, because full rewrites of major packages were not occurring as often as they were in the jumps between GNOME 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 versions.

GNOME 40 organizes the activities overview in a horizontal fashion, instead of using a vertical design like its predecessors.[73] The release also brings new [touchpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad "Touchpad") gestures.[76]

GNOME 40

GNOME 41

GNOME 41 was released on 22 September 2021 and introduced a rewritten and redesigned [GNOME Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Software "GNOME Software") application manager, a multitasking panel and a mobile network (for [WWAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_WAN "Wireless WAN")) panel in settings, a new [remote desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_desktop_software "Remote desktop software") app called Connections, updates to GNOME Music app, and improvements to the power mode settings.[77]

GNOME 42 was released on 23 March 2022 [78] and introduced the option to screen record and switch light/dark themes using a new GTK API called [Libadwaita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adwaita_(design_language) "Adwaita (design language)"). It switched some defaults apps such as Text Editor instead of [Gedit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedit "Gedit")and Console instead of Terminal/Tilix (said to only be replaced for non-advanced users).[79]

GNOME 43 (Guadalajara) was released on 21 September 2022[80] and introduced a new quick settings menu, a [GNOME Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Files "GNOME Files") update to [GTK4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK "GTK"), and a new 'Device [[Security]]' panel in settings, among many other changes. [GNOME Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Web "GNOME Web") was updated, bringing in support for web apps and experimental [Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox "Firefox")and [Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome "Google Chrome") extension support.

GNOME 44 (Kuala Lumpur) was released on 22 March 2023. Named after [Kuala Lumpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur "Kuala Lumpur") in recognition of work done by the GNOME.Asia community,[81] GNOME 44 introduced a new file chooser grid view, updated settings panels, and redesigned accessibility settings. The new quick settings menu introduced in GNOME 43 was updated, alongside the addition of several new apps and improvements to existing apps.[81]

GNOME 45 (Rīga) was released on 20 September 2023.[82] It introduced redesigned app styles alongside a new activities button, which replaced both the previous "Activities" label and the app menu with a graphical [workspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_desktop "Virtual desktop")indicator. Other updates to the system bar included a new camera usage indicator and a [keyboard shortcut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_shortcut "Keyboard shortcut") to open and close the quick settings menu. GNOME 45 also introduced two new image viewer and camera apps, keyboard backlight controls, and numerous enhancements to existing apps.[82]

GNOME 46 has not yet been released (its stable release is expected on 20 March 2024[83]) but its alpha was released on 12 January 2024[84] and beta on 10 February 2024.[85] Notable changes include the system monitor being ported to GTK4, headless remote login via [GDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Display_Manager "GNOME Display Manager") (RDP only) is now supported, [Nautilus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Files "GNOME Files")now asks to enter a password twice when creating password protected ZIP archives and will now also detect when a file being moved to a [FAT32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat32 "Fat32") volume is over 4GB in size, among other changes.[86]

## Releases

### Release cycle

Each of the component software products in the GNOME project has its own version number and [release schedule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle "Software release life cycle"). However, individual module maintainers coordinate their efforts to create a full GNOME stable release on an approximately six-month schedule,[87] alongside its underlying libraries such as GTK and GLib. Some experimental projects are excluded from these releases.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Before GNOME 40, GNOME version numbers followed the scheme _v.xx.yy_.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Here, _v_ is a major version, which can include large changes such as [ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface "Application binary interface")breakage; these have no regular schedule and occur in response to requirements for large-scale changes[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]. _xx_ is a minor version, released on the above schedule of approximately every 6 months, in which the 1- or 2-digit number's parity indicates the type of release: if _xx_ is even (e.g. 3.20) the release is considered stable, whereas if _xx_ is odd, it represents a current development snapshot (e.g. 3.21) that will eventually evolve into the next stable release.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] _yy_ indicates a point release, e.g. 3.20.6; these are made on a frequency of weeks in order to fix issues, add non-breaking enhancements, etc.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

GNOME 40 started a new versioning scheme in which a single number is incremented with each biannual release. The number is followed by a dot and then "alpha", "beta", or "rc" for a development release, or a decimal for a minor stable release (much like the _yy_ mentioned previously).[75]

GNOME releases are made to the main FTP server in the form of [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code")with [configure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configure_(computing) "Configure (computing)") scripts[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_], which are compiled by operating system vendors and integrated with the rest of their systems before distribution. Most vendors only use stable and tested versions of GNOME and provide it in the form of easily installed, pre-compiled packages. The source code of every stable and development version of GNOME is stored in the GNOME [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software) "Git (software)") [source code repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_repository "Source code repository")[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_].

A number of build [scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_programming_language "Scripting programming language") (such as JHBuild or formerly GARNOME) are available to help automate the process of compiling the source code.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

## Features

### User interface design

Main article: [Adwaita (design language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adwaita_(design_language) "Adwaita (design language)")

See also: [Worse is better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better "Worse is better"), [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle "KISS principle"), and [Principles of user interface design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_user_interface_design "Principles of user interface design")

Since GNOME 2, productivity has been a key focus for GNOME. To meet this end, the GNOME [Human Interface Guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Interface_Guidelines "Human Interface Guidelines") (HIG) were created. All GNOME programs share a coherent style of [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical user interface") (GUI) but are not limited to the employment of the same [GUI widgets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUI_widget "GUI widget"). Rather, the design of the GNOME GUI is guided by concepts described in the GNOME HIG, itself relying on insights from [cognitive ergonomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_ergonomics "Cognitive ergonomics").[120] Following the HIG, developers can create high-quality, consistent, and usable GUI programs, as it addresses everything from GUI design to the recommended pixel-based layout of widgets.

During the GNOME 2 rewrite, many settings deemed of little value to the majority of users were removed. The guiding principle was outlined by [Havoc Pennington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havoc_Pennington "Havoc Pennington")– a software developer involved in the project – who emphasized the idea that it is better to make software behave correctly by default than to add a UI preference to get the desired behavior:

> A traditional free software application is configurable so that it has the union of all features anyone's ever seen in any equivalent application on any other historical platform. Or even configurable to be the union of all applications that anyone's ever seen on any historical platform ([Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs "Emacs") *cough*).
> 
> Does this hurt anything? Yes it does. It turns out that preferences have a cost. [..] [E]ach one has a price, and you have to carefully consider its value. Many users and developers don't understand this, and end up with a lot of cost and little value for their preferences dollar.
> 
> — [Havoc Pennington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havoc_Pennington "Havoc Pennington"), _Free software UI_[121]none

### Accessibility

See also: [Computer accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_accessibility "Computer accessibility") and [Orca (assistive technology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orca_(assistive_technology) "Orca (assistive technology)")

GNOME aims to make and keep the desktop environment [physically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics "Human factors and ergonomics") and [cognitively ergonomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_ergonomics "Cognitive ergonomics") for people with [disabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability "Disability"). The GNOME HIG tries to take this into account as far as possible but specific issues are solved by special software.

GNOME addresses [computer accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_accessibility "Computer accessibility") issues by using the [Accessibility Toolkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility_Toolkit "Accessibility Toolkit") (ATK) [application programming interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface "Application programming interface"), which allows enhancing user experience by using special [input methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method "Input method") and [speech synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis "Speech synthesis") and [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition "Speech recognition") software. Particular utilities are registered with ATK using [Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistive_Technology_Service_Provider_Interface "Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface") (AT-SPI), and become globally used throughout the desktop. Several assistive technology providers, including [Orca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orca_(assistive_technology) "Orca (assistive technology)")screen reader and [Dasher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasher_(software) "Dasher (software)") input method, were developed specifically for use with GNOME.

### Internationalization and localization

||This section **needs expansion** with:   <br><br>- support for special fonts<br>- right to left fonts You can help by [adding to it](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GNOME&action=edit&section=).  _(June 2021)_|

The internationalization and localization of GNOME software relies on [locale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale_(computer_software) "Locale (computer software)")[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_], and supports 197 languages with varying levels of completion, with some not being translated at all.[122]

### Desktop and mobile sessions

GNOME allows for at least three different kinds of [login sessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login_session "Login session") for desktop and one for mobile:

#### GNOME Shell

Main article: [GNOME Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Shell "GNOME Shell")

[GNOME Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Shell "GNOME Shell") is the default [graphical shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing) "Shell (computing)") of GNOME. It features a top bar holding (from left to right) an Activities button, an application menu, a clock and an integrated system status menu.[123][124] The application menu displays the name of the application in focus and provides access to functions such as accessing the application's preferences, closing the application, or creating a new application window. The status menu holds various system status indicators, shortcuts to system settings, and session actions including logging out, switching users, locking the screen, and suspending the computer.

Clicking on the Activities button, moving the mouse to the top-left hot corner or pressing the [Super key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_key_(keyboard_button) "Super key (keyboard button)") brings up the Overview.[125] The Overview gives users an overview of current activities and provides a way to switch between windows and workspaces and to launch applications. The Dash on the bottom houses shortcuts to favorite applications, currently open windows, and an application picker button to show a list of all installed applications.[123] A search bar appears at the top and a workspace list for viewing and switching between workspaces is directly above it. Notifications appear from the top of the shell.[126]

#### GNOME Classic

Beginning with GNOME 3.8, GNOME provides a suite of officially supported GNOME Shell extensions that provide Applications menu (a basic [start menu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_menu "Start menu")) and "Places menu" on the top bar, and a panel with windows list at the bottom of the screen that lets quickly minimize and restore open windows, a "Show Desktop" button in the bottom left and virtual desktops in the bottom right corner.[127] GNOME Classic also adds the minimize and maximize buttons to window headers.

GNOME Classic 3.36 (March 2020)

GNOME Classic 3.12 with GNOME Files (March 2014)

#### GNOME Flashback

_GNOME Flashback_ is an official session for GNOME 3. Based on [GNOME Panel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Panel "GNOME Panel")and [Metacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacity "Metacity"),[128] it is lightweight,[129][130] has lower hardware requirements, and uses less [system resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_resources "System resources") than [GNOME Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Shell "GNOME Shell").[131] It provides a traditional and highly customizable [taskbar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskbar "Taskbar") (panel) with many plug-ins bundled in one package (gnome-applets) including a customizable [start menu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_menu "Start menu"). It provides a similar user experience to the GNOME 2.x series and has customization capacities as built-in.

GNOME Flashback consists of the following components:

- [Metacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacity "Metacity") (window manager)
- [GNOME Panel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Panel "GNOME Panel") – a highly configurable taskbar
- [gnome-applets](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeApplets) – a collection of useful [applets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applet "Applet") for the GNOME Panel

### Mobile

See also: [Phosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosh "Phosh")

The libhandy library can be used with [GNOME Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Shell "GNOME Shell") to create a responsive [user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface "User interface") that dynamically adapts to device form factor.[132] With the release of GTK4 the libhandy library was replaced by the libadwaita library for creating responsive user interfaces.[133][134]

## Development

GNOME is developed by [GNOME Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Project "GNOME Project").[136] GNOME development is loosely managed. Since the introduction of [Discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_(software) "Discourse (software)") forum in 2019, the discussion moved from [mailing lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailing_list "Mailing list") and in October 2022, the project announced the plan to close all its public mailing lists.[137]

GNOME developers and users gather at an annual [GUADEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUADEC "GUADEC") meeting to discuss the current state and the future direction of GNOME.[138] GNOME incorporates standards and programs from [freedesktop.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedesktop.org "Freedesktop.org") to better support [interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability "Interoperability")with other desktops.

GNOME is mainly written in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)"), [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML"), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++"), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) "C Sharp (programming language)"), [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML"), [Vala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vala_(programming_language) "Vala (programming language)"), [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)"), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript"), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS "CSS"), and more.[6] A number of [language bindings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_binding "Language binding") [are available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_language_bindings_for_GTK "List of language bindings for GTK").

### Development platform

### Dependencies

The GNOME desktop environment does not consist solely of the graphical control element library GTK and the core applications that make use of it. There are quite a few additional software packages that make up the GNOME desktop environment, such as the above.

#### Windowing System

Main article: [Windowing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windowing_system "Windowing system")

GNOME runs on [Wayland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol) "Wayland (protocol)") and the [X Window System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System "X Window System") (specifically [X.Org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.Org_Server "X.Org Server")).[140]Wayland support was introduced in GNOME 3.10[124] and deemed "for the majority of users […] a usable day to day experience" by 3.20,[141] at which point Wayland became the default user session.[142] With GNOME 3.24, Wayland compatibility was extended to [Nvidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia "Nvidia") drivers.[143] In GNOME 3.30 or later, it is possible to run GNOME without X running at startup, using only Wayland.[144]

#### systemd

Main article: [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd "Systemd")

In May 2011 [Lennart Poettering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennart_Poettering "Lennart Poettering") proposed [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd "Systemd") as a GNOME dependency.[145] As systemd is available only on Linux, the proposal led to a discussion of possibly dropping support for other platforms in future GNOME releases. Since GNOME 3.2 [multiseat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiseat_configuration "Multiseat configuration") support has only been available on systems using systemd.[110] In November 2012 the GNOME release team concluded there will be no compile time dependency on systemd for basic functionality, like session tracking. For non-basic functionality, like power management, compile time dependency is possible. For example, there is no concept of systemd inhibitors in alternatives like consolekit. A package manager may want to ensure that the system is not turned off while the upgrade is taking place.[146] [147]

## Applications

### Core Applications

Main article: [GNOME Core Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Core_Applications "GNOME Core Applications")

There are a large number of [GTK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK "GTK") and [Clutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutter_(software) "Clutter (software)")-based programs written by various authors. Since the release of GNOME 3.0, [GNOME Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Project "GNOME Project") concentrates on developing a set of programs that accounts for the GNOME Core Applications.[148] The commonalities of the GNOME Core Applications are the adherence to the current GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) as well as the tight integration with underlying GNOME layers like e.g. [GVfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GVfs "GVfs") (GNOME virtual filesystem) and also with one another e.g. GOA (gnome-online-accounts)[149]settings and [GNOME Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Files "GNOME Files") with [Google Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Drive "Google Drive")[150][151] and [GNOME Photos](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GNOME_Photos&action=edit&redlink=1 "GNOME Photos (page does not exist)") with [Google Photos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Photos "Google Photos"). Some programs are simply existing programs with a new name and revamped user interface, while others have been written from scratch.

### Games

See also: [Open-source video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_video_game "Open-source video game")

GNOME Games have the look and feel of the GNOME Core Applications and are released simultaneously with GNOME. All have been rewritten to conform to the current GNOME Human Interface Guidelines.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Development tools

Programmers have written software to provide development tools consistent with the GNOME desktop and to facilitate the development of GNOME software.

[GNOME Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Builder "GNOME Builder") is the official [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment "Integrated development environment") developed by the GNOME project, replacing [Anjuta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anjuta "Anjuta"). [Glade Interface Designer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glade_Interface_Designer "Glade Interface Designer") was a [RAD IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface_builder "Graphical user interface builder")for GTK 3, however it was discontinued in 2022 and does not support GTK 4. GTK ships with GTK Inspector to inspect the widget tree of an application for debugging.[152] Gnome additionally ships [Devhelp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devhelp "Devhelp") to browse API documentation.

Integration options for third-party development tools (e.g. [NoFlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=NoFlo&action=edit&redlink=1 "NoFlo (page does not exist)")) also exist.[153]

The libsoup library enables access to HTTP servers from GNOME applications.[154]

BuildStream is a flexible and extensible framework for the modeling of build and CI pipelines in a declarative [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML "YAML") format, written in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)").[155]
