# What is the Web and [[Cybersecurity]]?
- the web refers to the vast network of interconnected documents and resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs, accessible via the internet
- [[cybersecurity]] involves protecting those internet-connected systems, including hardware, software, and [[data]], from cyberattacks or unauthorized access

# Importance of [[Cybersecurity]] on the Web
- as the web has become integral to personal, educational, and business activities, its [[security]] is paramount
	- protects sensitive [[data]] from theft or damage
	- ensures privacy for users
	- maintains trust in digital transactions and communications
- a breach in [[cybersecurity]] can lead to:
	- financial losses
	- damage to reputation
	- legal consequences
	- national [[security]] threats
### [[Security]] & [[Encryption]] Principles

- The internet is inherently insecure, highlighting the importance of web [[security]].
- Basic [[security]] principles include [[Confidentiality]], [[Integrity]], and [[Availability]] (CIA).

### [[Confidentiality]]

- Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized users.
- Mechanisms include [[encryption]], [[authentication]], access controls, and secure transmission protocols.

### [[Integrity]]

- Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and its processing methods.
- Measures include ensuring [[data]] can only be altered by authorized users and employing audit trails, hashes, checksums, and message digests for detection.

### [[Availability]]

- Making sure authorized users have access to information and processing when needed.
- This includes systems surviving failures (using hot/cold standby mechanisms) and resisting attacks (such as Denial of Service attacks).

### [[Security]] Services and Attacks

- [[Security]] services utilize mechanisms to protect against attacks that compromise the [[security]] of information.
- Types of attacks include those against [[availability]], [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], and authenticity.
- Typical [[security]] services include [[confidentiality]] ([[encryption]]), [[authentication]], [[integrity]] verification, non-repudiation, access control, and ensuring [[availability]].

### [[Encryption]]

- [[Encryption]] is crucial for converting plaintext into ciphertext to keep it unreadable by unintended recipients.
- Both symmetric key (secret key) and asymmetric key (public key) [[cryptography]] are used for [[encryption]], with applications in SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for web [[security]].

### Hashing

- Hashing ensures [[data]] [[integrity]] by applying a code on [[data]], such as emails or electronic documents, to verify it hasn't been modified.
- This is typically used in secure email, digital signatures on documents, and software validation.

### [[Authentication]]

- [[Authentication]] verifies identity and is key for non-repudiation and access control.
- It involves verifying something the user knows (e.g., a password), has (e.g., a token), or is ([[Biometric|biometric data]]).

### Access Controls

- These are measures, both physical and logical, enforced at various levels (operating system, application, [[security]] devices) to manage and restrict access to resources.

### Audit Log and Risk Assessment

- Audit logs are vital for measuring [[security]] effectiveness, conducting forensics, and generating alerts.
- Risk assessment helps in understanding and mitigating internal or external threats, including vandalism, espionage, and theft.

# Common [[Cybersecurity]] Threats on the Web
- malware (viruses, worms, trojan horses)
	- malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to systems
- phishing
	- fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication
- ransomware
	- a type of malware that threatens to publish the victim's [[data]] or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid
- DDoS attacks (Distributed Denial of Service)
	- attempts to disrupt normal web traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic

# [[Cybersecurity]] Measures
- [[encryption]]
	- converting information or [[data]] into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access
- firewalls
	- network [[security]] systems that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined [[security]] rules
- antivirus software
	- designed to detect, prevent, and remove malware
- secure passwords and [[authentication]] methods
	- using strong, unique passwords and methods like two-factor [[authentication]] (2FA) to enhance [[security]]
- regular software updates
	- keeping software and systems up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities

# The Role of HTTPS in Web [[Security]]
- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
	- an extension of HTTP, used for secure communication over a computer network, and widely used on the internet
- importance
	- encrypts [[data]] exchanged between a user's browser and the website they are visiting, protecting against eavesdropping and tampering
	- provides [[authentication]] of the accessed website, preventing [[man]]-in-the-middle attacks

# [[Cybersecurity]] Education and Awareness
- educating users about safe web practices is crucial in enhancing [[cybersecurity]]
	- recognizing and avoiding phishing emails
	- understanding the importance of regular software updates
	- the significance of using strong, unique passwords
- organizations often conduct [[cybersecurity]] awareness training to mitigate the risk of human error, which can lead to [[security]] breaches
