# What is the Web and [[Cybersecurity]]?
- the web refers to the vast network of interconnected documents and resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs, accessible via the internet
- [[cybersecurity]] involves protecting those internet-connected systems, including hardware, software, and data, from cyberattacks or unauthorized access

# Importance of [[Cybersecurity]] on the Web
- as the web has become integral to personal, educational, and business activities, its [[security]] is paramount
	- protects sensitive data from theft or damage
	- ensures privacy for users
	- maintains trust in digital transactions and communications
- a breach in [[cybersecurity]] can lead to:
	- financial losses
	- damage to reputation
	- legal consequences
	- national [[security]] threats

# Common [[Cybersecurity]] Threats on the Web
- malware (viruses, worms, trojan horses)
	- malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to systems
- phishing
	- fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication
- ransomware
	- a type of malware that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid
- DDoS attacks (Distributed Denial of Service)
	- attempts to disrupt normal web traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic

# [[Cybersecurity]] Measures
- [[encryption]]
	- converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access
- firewalls
	- network [[security]] systems that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined [[security]] rules
- antivirus software
	- designed to detect, prevent, and remove malware
- secure passwords and authentication methods
	- using strong, unique passwords and methods like two-factor authentication (2FA) to enhance [[security]]
- regular software updates
	- keeping software and systems up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities

# The Role of HTTPS in Web [[Security]]
- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
	- an extension of HTTP, used for secure communication over a computer network, and widely used on the internet
- importance
	- encrypts data exchanged between a user's browser and the website they are visiting, protecting against eavesdropping and tampering
	- provides authentication of the accessed website, preventing [[man]]-in-the-middle attacks

# [[Cybersecurity]] Education and Awareness
- educating users about safe web practices is crucial in enhancing [[cybersecurity]]
	- recognizing and avoiding phishing emails
	- understanding the importance of regular software updates
	- the significance of using strong, unique passwords
- organizations often conduct [[cybersecurity]] awareness training to mitigate the risk of human error, which can lead to [[security]] breaches
