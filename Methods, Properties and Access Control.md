ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Methods and properties define an [[object]]'s behavior and [[state]], while access control restricts their visibility and modification.

MAIN POINTS:
1. Methods are functions defined within a [[class]] or [[object]] that operate on its data.
2. Properties represent the data or [[state]] of an [[object]], often accessed through getters and setters.
3. Access control mechanisms, like public, private, and protected, govern access to an [[object]]'s methods and properties.
4. [[Encapsulation]] is achieved through the use of private properties and methods, ensuring internal data [[integrity]].
5. [[Inheritance]] allows subclasses to inherit and override parent [[class]] methods and properties.
6. Static methods and properties belong to the [[class]], not instances, and are accessed directly via the [[class]].
7. Computed properties calculate a value rather than store it directly, often based on other property values.
8. Property observers can monitor and respond to changes in a property's value.
9. Access modifiers in [[programming languages]] enforce [[encapsulation]] and protect [[object]]-oriented code from unintended use.
10. [[Polymorphism]] enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common [[superclass]].

TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding access control is crucial for protecting sensitive data within an [[object]].
2. Methods and properties are fundamental to [[object-oriented programming]], defining interactions and states of objects.
3. [[Encapsulation]] promotes code [[modularity]] and [[maintenance]] by hiding internal states and behaviors.
4. The use of [[inheritance]] and [[polymorphism]] enhances [[code reusability]] and [[flexibility]].
5. Properly implemented access control can prevent bugs and [[security]] vulnerabilities in [[software applications]].
