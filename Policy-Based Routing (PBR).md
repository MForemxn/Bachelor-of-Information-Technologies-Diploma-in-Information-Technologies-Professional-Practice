# What is Policy-Based Routing (PBR)?
- Policy-Based Routing (PBR) is a technique used to make routing decisions based on policies set by the network administrator.
- Unlike traditional routing, which makes decisions based solely on the destination address of packets, PBR considers various criteria such as source address, protocol, port number, and even packet size.
- PBR allows for more granular control over traffic flow within a network, enabling administrators to direct traffic through specific paths based on the defined policies.

# How Policy-Based Routing Works
- PBR works by applying policies to the traffic at the ingress point of the router.
- These policies are defined by the administrator and are often implemented using access control lists (ACLs) or route maps.
- When a packet arrives at a router configured with PBR, the router evaluates the packet against the defined policies.
- If the packet matches a policy, the router forwards the packet according to the actions specified in that policy, which could include routing the packet through a particular interface or path.
- If the packet does not match any policy, it is then processed using the traditional routing table.

# Applications of Policy-Based Routing
- Load Balancing: PBR can be used to distribute traffic evenly across multiple links, improving bandwidth utilization and network performance.
- Traffic Segregation: PBR allows for the segregation of traffic types, ensuring that sensitive or critical traffic can be routed through more secure or reliable paths.
- Cost Reduction: By directing traffic through less expensive links for certain types of traffic, PBR can help reduce operational costs.
- Enhanced [[Security]]: PBR can be used to route traffic from specific sources or carrying specific types of [[data]] through firewalls or other [[security]] devices for additional scrutiny.

# Configuring Policy-Based Routing
- Configuration of PBR involves defining the criteria for traffic classification and the actions to be taken when those criteria are met.
- This typically involves creating access control lists (ACLs) to match the desired traffic and route maps to specify the routing actions.
- The route maps are then applied to the appropriate interfaces on the router, enabling PBR for traffic passing through those interfaces.
- It's important for administrators to carefully plan and test PBR configurations to ensure that traffic is routed as intended without unintended consequences.

# Considerations and Limitations
- Complexity: PBR can add complexity to network configurations, making troubleshooting and maintenance more challenging.
- Performance Impact: PBR requires additional processing by routers, which could impact performance, especially on high-traffic networks.
- Scalability: As networks grow, maintaining and updating PBR policies can become increasingly difficult, requiring careful management and documentation.
- Compatibility: Not all routing devices support PBR, or they may support it with varying levels of functionality, which needs to be considered when designing network architectures.
