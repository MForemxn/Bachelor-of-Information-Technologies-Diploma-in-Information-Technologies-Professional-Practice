# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Non-repudiation ensures that a party in a digital transaction cannot deny the authenticity of their signature or the sending of a message.

# OVERVIEW:
Non-repudiation is a [[security]] principle that provides proof of the origin and [[integrity]] of [[data]], ensuring that a party involved in a digital transaction cannot deny their involvement. This concept is crucial in digital communications and transactions, as it prevents individuals or [[entities]] from denying actions they have taken, such as sending a message or signing a document. Non-repudiation is typically achieved through the use of digital signatures and [[encryption]]. Digital signatures, created using cryptographic algorithms, provide a unique identifier that verifies the sender's identity and confirms that the message has not been altered. This is essential for maintaining trust in electronic transactions, especially in e-commerce, legal agreements, and secure communications. Non-repudiation also involves maintaining logs and records that can be used as evidence in disputes. By ensuring [[accountability]] and authenticity, non-repudiation supports the [[integrity]] and reliability of digital interactions.
