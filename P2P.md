# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking allows direct [[data]] exchange between devices without relying on a central server, enhancing decentralisation and resource sharing.

# OVERVIEW:
Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking is a decentralized communication model where each device, or "peer," can act as both a client and a server. This setup allows peers to share resources, such as files or processing power, directly with each other without the need for a central server. P2P networks are commonly used for file-sharing applications, such as BitTorrent, where users can download and upload files simultaneously. This model enhances network resilience and [[scalability]], as the failure of a single node does not disrupt the entire network. P2P networking is also used in blockchain technology, online gaming, and collaborative platforms. However, it can pose [[security]] challenges, as the lack of central control makes it harder to monitor and manage. Despite this, P2P networks are valued for their efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and ability to leverage distributed resources.
