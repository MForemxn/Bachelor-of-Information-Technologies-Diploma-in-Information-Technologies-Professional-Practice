- CLI's can only take text inputs, and can only output text. 
	- this means the only way of humans interacting with a CLI is using a keyboard.
- CLI's were the first UI's ever created
- Usually, these are:
	- [[Sh]] (1969), which was the predecessor to [[Bash]], and [[CSH (C Shell)]]
	- [[PM (Power Platform)]] (1973), which was the predecessor to [[MS-DOS]]
- the command line can be accessed though
	- CMD.exe on windows
	- Terminal.app on MacOS
	- Terminal on Linux
# Command Line Interface (CLI)
- a text-based interface used for interacting with software and [[operating systems]]
- allows users to type commands directly to the system, providing more control and flexibility
- often preferred by more advanced users due to its precision and the ability to automate tasks

# Advantages of CLI
- **Efficiency and Speed**: executing commands through CLI can be much faster than navigating through a graphical [[user interface]] ([[GUI]])
- **Scripting and Automation**: allows for the creation of scripts to automate repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing the potential for human error
- **Resource Consumption**: generally consumes fewer system resources than GUIs, making it ideal for older hardware or systems with limited resources
- **[[Remote Access]]**: CLI is particularly useful for remote system management, as it can be accessed and used effectively over low-bandwidth connections

# Disadvantages of CLI
- **Steep Learning Curve**: can be intimidating for beginners due to the need to memorise commands and understand their syntax
- **Less Intuitive**: without graphical elements, users must have a good understanding of the system's structure and the commands they need to use
- **Error Prone**: a small typo can result in completely different outcomes or, in worst cases, system errors

# Common CLI Environments
- **Unix/Linux Shells**: such as [[Bash]], Zsh, and Fish, offering powerful scripting capabilities and a wide range of commands
- **Windows Command Prompt**: provides a set of commands for managing Windows environments
- **PowerShell**: more advanced than Command Prompt, offering a more powerful scripting language and access to a wider range of system functions
- **Terminal Emulators**: software applications that replicate the functionality of traditional computer terminals, allowing access to a shell within a [[GUI]]

# Learning CLI
- **Documentation and [[Help]] Commands**: most CLI environments provide [[help]] commands (`man`, `help`, etc.) that display usage information for commands
- **Online Resources**: numerous tutorials, forums, and communities are available online to assist beginners in learning CLI commands and scripting
- **Practice**: like any skill, proficiency with CLI comes with practice. Starting with basic commands and gradually moving to more complex tasks is a good strategy

# CLI vs [[GUI]]
- the choice between CLI and [[GUI]] depends on the user's needs, expertise, and the specific task at hand
- CLI offers speed, efficiency, and flexibility for those willing to learn its intricacies, while [[GUI]] provides a more user-friendly and visually intuitive interface for everyday tasks
