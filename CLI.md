- CLI's can only take text inputs, and can only output text. 
	- this means the only way of humans interacting with a CLI is using a keyboard.
- CLI's were the first UI's ever created
- Usually, these are:
	- [[Sh]] (1969), which was the predecessor to [[Bash]], and [[CSH (C Shell)]]
	- [[PM (Power Platform)]] (1973), which was the predecessor to [[MS-DOS]]
- the command line can be accessed though
	- CMD.exe on windows
	- Terminal.app on MacOS
	- Terminal on Linux
