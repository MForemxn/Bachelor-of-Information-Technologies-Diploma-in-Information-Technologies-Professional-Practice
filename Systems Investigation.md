# What is Systems Investigation?
- systems investigation is the initial phase in the systems development life cycle (SDLC)
- it involves:
	- understanding and documenting the current system
	- identifying the system's weaknesses and areas for improvement
	- gathering requirements for the new system
- this phase is critical for the success of the project as it sets the foundation for all future work

# Importance of Systems Investigation
- ensures that the project is feasible and worth pursuing
	- includes technical, economic, and legal feasibility studies
- helps in understanding the stakeholders' needs and expectations
- prevents wastage of resources on unviable projects
- aids in setting clear objectives and scope for the project

# Steps in Systems Investigation
1. **Problem [[Identification]]**
	- recognising and defining the problem or opportunity
2. **Feasibility Study**
	- assessing the viability of the project from various perspectives
3. **Information Gathering**
	- collecting [[data]] about the current system and user requirements through interviews, surveys, observation, etc.
4. **Analysis**
	- examining the collected information to identify the requirements and constraints of the new system
5. **Report Preparation**
	- documenting the findings, recommendations, and the proposed plan of action

# Tools and Techniques
- **Interviews and Questionnaires**
	- direct interaction with stakeholders to gather detailed information
- **Observation**
	- understanding the current system by observing it in operation
- **Document Analysis**
	- reviewing existing documentation and records to understand the current system
- **Workshops**
	- collaborative sessions with stakeholders to gather requirements and ideas

# Challenges in Systems Investigation
- resistance from users and stakeholders
	- fear of change or loss of job
- difficulty in gathering accurate and complete information
	- due to poor documentation or lack of cooperation
- underestimating the complexity of the current system
- managing expectations and scope creep

# Role of Systems Analyst
- acts as a bridge between the users and the technical team
- responsible for conducting the systems investigation effectively
	- includes planning, executing, and managing all the activities mentioned above
- must possess strong communication, analytical, and problem-solving skills

# Outcome of Systems Investigation
- a comprehensive report that includes:
	- a detailed description of the current system
	- identified problems and opportunities
	- feasibility study results
	- requirements for the new system
	- recommendations and proposed plan for moving forward

# Conclusion
- systems investigation is a crucial phase in the SDLC that requires careful planning, execution, and management
- the success of this phase greatly influences the overall success of the project
