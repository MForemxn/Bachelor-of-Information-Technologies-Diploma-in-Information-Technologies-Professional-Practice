# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Memory management in [[operating systems]] involves efficiently allocating, tracking, and optimizing memory usage to ensure system stability and performance.

# OVERVIEW:
Memory management is a core [[function]] of an operating system (OS) that handles the allocation and deallocation of memory resources to various [[processes]] and applications. It ensures that each [[process]] has sufficient memory to execute efficiently while maintaining overall system stability. The OS uses techniques such as paging, segmentation, and virtual memory to manage memory effectively. Paging divides memory into fixed-size blocks, allowing non-contiguous [[memory allocation]], which reduces fragmentation. Segmentation, on the other hand, divides memory into variable-sized segments based on logical divisions. Virtual memory extends physical memory onto disk storage, enabling systems to run larger applications than the available physical memory would allow. Memory management also involves tracking memory usage, protecting memory spaces from unauthorized access, and optimizing [[memory allocation]] to prevent leaks and fragmentation. Effective memory management is crucial for maximizing system performance, ensuring efficient multitasking, and providing a seamless user experience.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Memory management allocates and deallocates memory to [[processes]].

3. Virtual memory extends physical memory using disk storage.
4. Memory tracking prevents leaks and optimizes usage.
5. [[Protection mechanisms]] prevent unauthorized memory access.
6. Efficient management reduces fragmentation and maximizes performance.
7. It ensures [[processes]] have sufficient memory for execution.
8. Memory management supports multitasking and system stability.
9. It involves managing [[memory allocation]], tracking, and optimization.
10. Crucial for running large applications and maintaining system efficiency.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Memory management is essential for efficient OS operation and resource allocation.
