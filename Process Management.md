# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
[[Process]] management in [[operating systems]] involves creating, scheduling, and terminating [[processes]] to ensure efficient execution and resource allocation.

# OVERVIEW:
[[Process]] management is a fundamental [[function]] of an operating system (OS) that oversees the execution of [[processes]], which are instances of running programs. It involves several key activities, including [[process]] creation, scheduling, synchronization, and termination. The OS is responsible for allocating necessary resources such as CPU time, memory, and I/O devices to each [[process]], ensuring that they run efficiently and without interference. [[Process]] scheduling is crucial, as it determines the order and duration for which [[processes]] access the CPU, using algorithms like round-robin, priority scheduling, or shortest job first. Synchronization mechanisms, such as semaphores and mutexes, are employed to manage [[process]] interactions and prevent issues like deadlocks and race conditions. Effective [[process]] management ensures optimal system performance, maximizes CPU utilization, and provides a responsive user experience. It also involves handling [[process]] states, transitions, and inter-[[process]] communication, which are essential for multitasking environments.
