# What is the Internet?
- the internet is a global network of computers and servers interconnected through communication protocols
- it enables:
	- [[data]] exchange across vast distances
	- access to information and resources
	- communication through email, messaging apps, and social media platforms
- it is the infrastructure that supports the web and other services

# The Internet vs. The Web
- [[the internet and the web]] are often used interchangeably but are distinct
	- the internet is the hardware and infrastructure layer
	- the web, or World Wide Web, is a service built on top of the internet using HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- the web allows for:
	- accessing websites and [[web applications]] through browsers
	- hyperlinking between documents and resources

# How the Internet Works
- relies on a packet routing network following the Internet Protocol (IP)
- uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to ensure [[data]] is reliably transmitted
- [[data]] travels through networks via routers and switches, finding the most efficient path

# Key Components of the Internet
- Internet Service Providers (ISPs): companies that provide internet access to consumers and businesses
- Routers and switches: hardware that directs [[data]] packets across the network
- IP addresses: unique identifiers for devices on the internet
- Domain Name System (DNS): translates human-friendly domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses

# The Evolution of the Internet
- originated from ARPANET in the late 1960s, a project by the U.S. Department of Defense
- has evolved from a military and academic tool to a comprehensive global network
- continuous growth in infrastructure, speed, and accessibility

# The Web: A Layer on the Internet
- developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 at CERN
- uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to transmit [[data]]
- consists of web pages that are linked via hyperlinks and URLs
- web pages are written in HTML, styled with CSS, and often include JavaScript for interactivity

# Web Browsers
- software applications used to access and navigate the web
- common examples include Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render web pages

# Impact of [[the Internet and the Web]]
- revolutionized communication, commerce, education, and entertainment
- enabled the creation of new industries and transformed existing ones
- facilitated global connectivity and information sharing

# Challenges and Considerations
- issues of privacy, [[security]], and [[data protection]]
- digital divide: unequal access to the internet across different regions and demographics
- regulation and governance of internet content and services

# Future Directions
- advancements in internet infrastructure, such as 5G and beyond
- development of new web technologies and standards
- increasing focus on [[cybersecurity]] and ethical considerations
