# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The WannaCry ransomware attack exploited a Windows vulnerability to encrypt files on infected computers, demanding ransom payments for decryption [[keys]].

# OVERVIEW:
The WannaCry ransomware attack, which occurred in May 2017, was a global cyberattack that targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system. It exploited a vulnerability in the Windows Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, known as EternalBlue, which had been leaked from the U.S. National [[Security]] Agency (NSA). Once a computer was infected, WannaCry encrypted the files on the system and displayed a ransom note demanding payment in Bitcoin to unlock the files. The attack affected hundreds of thousands of computers across more than 150 countries, disrupting operations in various sectors, including healthcare, telecommunications, and logistics. The rapid spread of WannaCry was facilitated by its worm-like capabilities, allowing it to propagate across networks without user intervention. Microsoft had released a patch for the vulnerability prior to the attack, but many systems remained unpatched. The attack highlighted the critical importance of timely software updates and robust [[cybersecurity]] measures to protect against such threats.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. WannaCry targeted Windows systems using the EternalBlue vulnerability.
2. It encrypted files and demanded Bitcoin ransom for decryption.
3. Affected over 150 countries and numerous sectors globally.
4. Exploited unpatched systems despite available Microsoft updates.
5. Spread rapidly due to worm-like propagation capabilities.
6. Disrupted critical services, notably in healthcare and logistics.
7. Highlighted the importance of timely software updates.
8. Demonstrated the need for robust [[cybersecurity]] measures.
9. Originated from leaked NSA cyber tools.
10. Emphasized the global impact of ransomware attacks.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Timely patching of software vulnerabilities is crucial for [[security]].
2. Ransomware can have widespread and disruptive impacts.
3. [[Cybersecurity]] measures must be robust and proactive.
4. Understanding vulnerabilities like EternalBlue is essential for prevention.
5. Global cooperation is necessary to combat cyber threats effectively.
