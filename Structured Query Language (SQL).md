## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardised language used to manage and manipulate relational databases by performing tasks such as querying, updating, and managing data.

## OVERVIEW:
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a powerful and widely-used language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to perform a variety of tasks, including querying data, updating records, creating and modifying [[database]] structures, and controlling access to data. SQL is essential for interacting with databases, enabling users to retrieve specific information through SELECT statements, insert new data with INSERT statements, update existing records using UPDATE statements, and delete data with DELETE statements. Additionally, SQL supports the creation of [[database]] objects like tables, indexes, and views, and provides mechanisms for defining data [[integrity]] constraints. SQL's standardized [[syntax]] ensures compatibility across different [[database management systems (DBMS)]], making it a versatile tool for [[database]] administrators, developers, and analysts. By using SQL, organizations can efficiently manage large volumes of data, perform complex queries, and ensure data consistency and [[security]].
