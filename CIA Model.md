[[Introduction to System Security]]

# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The CIA Model is a framework for [[information security]] that focuses on maintaining [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], and [[availability]] of [[data]].

# OVERVIEW:
The CIA Model, also known as the CIA Triad, is a foundational concept in [[information security]] that aims to protect [[data]] through three core principles: [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], and [[availability]]. [[Confidentiality]] ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals, preventing unauthorized access and [[data]] breaches. [[Integrity]] involves maintaining the accuracy and consistency of [[data]], ensuring it is not altered or tampered with by unauthorized parties. [[Availability]] guarantees that information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed, minimizing downtime and ensuring reliable access. The CIA Model provides a comprehensive approach to safeguarding [[information systems]], guiding [[security]] policies, and [[risk management]] strategies. It is widely used across various industries to design secure systems and protect against threats such as hacking, [[data]] loss, and service disruptions.
