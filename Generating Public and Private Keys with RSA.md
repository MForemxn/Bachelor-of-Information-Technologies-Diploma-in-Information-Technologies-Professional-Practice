# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Generating RSA keys involves creating a pair of cryptographic keys, one public and one private, for secure communication.

# OVERVIEW:
RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used cryptographic algorithm that enables secure data transmission. It involves generating a pair of keys: a public key, which can be shared openly, and a private key, which must be kept confidential. The process begins with selecting two large prime numbers and multiplying them to produce a modulus. The public key is derived from this modulus and an exponent, while the private key is calculated using the modulus and a different exponent. RSA keys are essential for encrypting data, ensuring that only the intended recipient can decrypt it using their private key. This method is fundamental in securing online communications, digital signatures, and various encryption protocols.
