Adam Sandler is an American actor, comedian, screenwriter, and producer. 

He was born on September 9, 1966 in Brooklyn, New York. Sandler is known 

for his goofy, immature, and often controversial humor, which has made him

a popular figure in Hollywood.

  

Sandler's career began in the 1980s when he started performing at comedy 

clubs and on TV shows. He eventually landed a spot on "Saturday Night 

Live" (SNL), where he became a cast member from 1990 to 1995. During his 

time on SNL, Sandler became known for his funny characters and skits, 

which often poked fun at American culture and society.

  

After leaving SNL, Sandler began to pursue a career in film. His first 

major role was in the 1995 comedy "Billy Madison," in which he played a 

spoiled rich kid who must repeat grades 1 through 12 in order to inherit 

his father's hotel empire. The movie was a moderate success and helped 

establish Sandler as a leading man in Hollywood.

  

Over the next few years, Sandler starred in a number of successful comedy 

films, including "Happy Gilmore" (1996), "The Wedding Singer" (1998), and 

"Big Daddy" (1999). These movies cemented Sandler's status as a comedy 

superstar and made him one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood.

  

In addition to his film career, Sandler has also produced several movies 

through his production company, Happy Madison Productions. Some of these 

productions include "Grown Ups" (2010), "Just Go with It" (2011), and 

"Blended" (2014).

  

Sandler has been married to Jacqueline Samantha Titone since 2003, and 

they have two daughters together. He is also known for his charity work, 

particularly in the area of education. Sandler has donated millions of 

dollars to various organizations over the years, including the Boys & 

Girls Clubs of America and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

  

Despite his success and popularity, Sandler has faced criticism throughout

his career for his controversial humor and what some have seen as a lack 

of depth in his acting roles. Nevertheless, he remains one of the most 

recognizable and influential figures in Hollywood comedy.
