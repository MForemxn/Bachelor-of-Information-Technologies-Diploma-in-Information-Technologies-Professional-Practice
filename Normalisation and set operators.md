## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Normalisation organises [[database]] tables to reduce redundancy and improve [[integrity]], while set operators manipulate and combine [[data]] sets in relational databases.

## OVERVIEW:
Normalisation is a systematic [[process]] in [[database]] design that organises tables to minimise redundancy and dependency by dividing larger tables into smaller, related ones. This [[process]] involves applying a series of normal forms, each with specific rules and criteria, to ensure [[data]] [[integrity]] and consistency. The primary goal is to eliminate anomalies in [[data]] operations such as insertion, update, and deletion. Set operators, on the other hand, are used in SQL to perform operations on [[data]] sets, allowing for the combination, intersection, and difference of [[data]] from multiple tables. Common set operators include UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT (or MINUS). These operators enable complex queries and [[data manipulation]], facilitating comprehensive [[data analysis]] and reporting. Together, normalisation and set operators enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and [[flexibility]] of relational databases.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Normalisation reduces redundancy and dependency in tables.
2. Divides larger tables into smaller, related ones.
3. Applies normal forms to ensure [[data]] [[integrity]].
4. Eliminates anomalies in [[data]] operations.
5. Set operators manipulate and combine [[data]] sets.
6. Common set operators: UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT.
7. UNION combines [[data]] from multiple tables.
8. INTERSECT finds common [[data]] between tables.
9. EXCEPT (MINUS) identifies differences between tables.
10. Enhances efficiency, accuracy, and [[flexibility]] of databases.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Normalisation organises tables to minimise redundancy and ensure [[data]] [[integrity]].
2. Normal forms are applied to eliminate [[data]] anomalies.
3. Set operators like UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT manipulate [[data]] sets.
4. These tools enable complex queries and comprehensive [[data analysis]].
5. Together, they improve the efficiency and accuracy of relational databases.
