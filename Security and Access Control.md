# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
[[Security]] and access control in computing involve protecting resources and [[data]] by regulating who can access or modify them, ensuring [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], and [[availability]].

# OVERVIEW:
[[Security]] and access control are fundamental aspects of computing that focus on safeguarding [[data]] and resources from unauthorized access and potential threats. Access control is a [[security]] technique that regulates who or what can view or use resources in a computing environment. It involves [[authentication]], which verifies the identity of users, and authorization, which determines their access rights. Common access control [[models]] include Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control (MAC), and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), each offering different levels of control and [[flexibility]]. [[Security]] measures also include [[encryption]], firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular audits to protect [[data]] [[integrity]] and [[confidentiality]]. Effective [[security]] and access control prevent [[data]] breaches, protect sensitive information, and ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions. They are crucial for maintaining trust, compliance with regulations, and the overall [[security]] posture of an organisation.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. [[Security]] and access control protect [[data]] and resources from unauthorized access.
2. Access control involves [[authentication]] and authorization [[processes]].
3. Common [[models]] include DAC, MAC, and RBAC.
4. [[Encryption]] and firewalls enhance [[data]] protection.
5. Intrusion detection systems monitor and respond to threats.
6. Regular audits ensure compliance and [[security]] effectiveness.
7. Prevents [[data]] breaches and protects sensitive information.
8. Ensures only authorized users can access or modify resources.
9. Maintains [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], and [[availability]] of [[data]].
10. Crucial for organisational trust and regulatory compliance.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. [[Security]] and access control are vital for protecting [[data]] and resources.
2. [[Authentication]] and authorization are key components of access control.
3. Different access control [[models]] offer varying levels of [[security]].
4. Regular [[security]] audits and monitoring are essential for threat prevention.
5. Understanding these concepts is crucial for maintaining a secure computing environment.
