# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) is an advanced, high-performance packet forwarding technology used to enhance network efficiency and scalability.

# OVERVIEW:
Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) is a sophisticated packet forwarding mechanism developed by Cisco to improve the speed and efficiency of data [[routing]] in large-scale networks. Unlike traditional methods such as process switching and fast switching, CEF uses a Forwarding Information Base (FIB) and an adjacency table to streamline the packet forwarding process. The FIB contains pre-computed routes, allowing for rapid packet forwarding without CPU intervention, while the adjacency table maintains Layer 2 addressing information. This separation of [[routing]] and forwarding functions significantly reduces latency and increases throughput, making CEF ideal for high-performance networks. CEF is particularly beneficial in environments with high traffic volumes, as it supports load balancing and enhances network scalability. By minimizing the processing burden on routers, CEF ensures consistent and reliable data transmission across complex network infrastructures.
