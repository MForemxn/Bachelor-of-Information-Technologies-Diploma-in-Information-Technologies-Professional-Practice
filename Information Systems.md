- At the highest level, information systems:
	- get the right information
	- to the right  people,
	- at the right time,
	- in the right amount,
	- in the right format.
- Because information systems are intended to  supply useful information, we need to differentiate between information and  two closely related terms: [[data]] and knowledge
	- [[Data]] : Raw fact, unorganized fact that needs to be processed and  organized to convey any specific meaning
		- (e.g., 3.11, 2.96, 3.95, 1.99, 2.08) and characters (e.g., B, A, C, A, B, D, F, C)
	- Information: [[Data]] that is processed by summing, ordering, averaging, grouping so that they have meaning and value to the recipient
	- Knowledge: [[Data]] and/or information that have been organised and  processed to convey experience, understanding , accumulated learning and expertise
# How can [[data]] be processed to form Information?
