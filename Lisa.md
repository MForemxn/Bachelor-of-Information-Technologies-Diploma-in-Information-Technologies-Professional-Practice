**Lisa** is a [desktop computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer "Desktop computer") developed by [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc."), released on January 19, 1983. It is generally considered the first mass-market [personal computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer") operable through a [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical user interface") (GUI). In 1983, a machine like the Lisa was still so expensive that it was primarily marketed to individual and small and medium-sized businesses as a groundbreaking new alternative to much bigger and more expensive [mainframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe "Mainframe") or [minicomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicomputer "Minicomputer") such as from [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM"), that either require additional, expensive consultancy from the supplier, hiring specially trained personnel, or at least, a much steeper learning curve to maintain and operate. Earlier GUI-controlled personal computers were not mass-marketed; for example, the [Xerox Alto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto "Xerox Alto") was manufactured only for [Xerox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox "Xerox") and select partners through [Xerox PARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_PARC "Xerox PARC") from the early to mid-1970s.

Development of project "LISA" began in 1978.[2] It underwent many changes and shipped at US$9,995 (equivalent to $29,400 in 2022) with a five-megabyte [hard drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive "Hard disk drive"). It was affected by its high price, insufficient software, unreliable [Apple FileWare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_FileWare "Apple FileWare") [floppy disks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk "Floppy disk"), and the imminent release of the cheaper and faster [Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K "Macintosh 128K").[3]: 79  Only 10,000 Lisa units were sold in two years.

Considered a commercial failure with technical acclaim, Lisa introduced several advanced features that reappeared on the Macintosh and eventually [IBM PC compatibles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible "IBM PC compatible"). These include an [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") with [memory protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_protection "Memory protection")[4] and a document-oriented workflow. The [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware "Computer hardware") is more advanced overall than the following Macintosh, including hard disk drive support, capacity for up to 2 [megabytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabyte "Megabyte") (MB) of [random-access memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory "Random-access memory") (RAM), expansion slots, and a larger, higher-resolution display.

The complexity of the Lisa operating system and its associated programs (especially its [office suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_software#Office_suite "Productivity software")), and the ad hoc protected memory implementation (due to the lack of a Motorola [memory management unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit "Memory management unit")), placed a high demand on the CPU and, to some extent, the storage system. As a result of cost-cutting measures designed to bring it more into the consumer market, advanced software, and factors such as the delayed [[availability]] of the 68000 processor and its impact on the design process, many said that Lisa's user experience was sluggish overall. The [workstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workstation "Workstation")-tier price (though at the low end) and lack of a technical software application library made it a difficult sale for much of the technical workstation market. Further impediments to the Lisa's acceptance were the runaway success of the IBM PC, and Apple's [[decision]] to essentially compete with itself via the lower-priced Macintosh.

In 1982, after [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs "Steve Jobs") was forced out of the Lisa project by Apple's board of directors,[5] he appropriated the Macintosh project from [Jef Raskin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin "Jef Raskin"), who had originally conceived of a sub-$1,000 text-based appliance computer in 1979. Jobs immediately redefined Macintosh as a less expensive and more focused version of the graphical Lisa.

When Macintosh launched in January 1984, it quickly surpassed Lisa's underwhelming sales. Jobs then began assimilating increasing numbers of Lisa staff, as he had done with the Apple II division after assuming control over Raskin's project. Newer Lisa [[models]] were eventually introduced to address its shortcomings but, even after lowering the list price considerably, the platform failed to achieve sales volumes comparable to the much less expensive Mac. The final model, the Lisa 2/10, was rebranded as the [Macintosh XL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_XL "Macintosh XL") to become the high-end model in the Macintosh series.[3]: 79 

## History

### Development

#### Name

Though the documentation shipped with the original Lisa only refers to it as "The Lisa", Apple officially stated that the name was an [acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym "Acronym") for "Locally Integrated Software Architecture".[6] Because Steve Jobs's first daughter was named [Lisa Nicole Brennan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Brennan-Jobs "Lisa Brennan-Jobs") (born in 1978), it was sometimes inferred that the name also had a personal association, and perhaps that the acronym was a [backronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym "Backronym") invented later to fit the name. [Andy Hertzfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hertzfeld "Andy Hertzfeld")[7] said that the acronym was [reverse-engineered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym "Backronym") from the name "Lisa" in late 1982 by the Apple marketing team after they had hired a marketing consultancy firm to come up with names to replace "Lisa" and "Macintosh" (at the time considered by [Jef Raskin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin "Jef Raskin") to be merely internal project codenames) and then rejected all of the suggestions. Privately, Hertzfeld and the other software developers used "Lisa: Invented Stupid Acronym", a [recursive backronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym "Recursive acronym"), while computer industry [pundits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit "Pundit") coined the term "Let's Invent Some Acronym" to fit Lisa's name. Decades later, Jobs told his biographer [Walter Isaacson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Isaacson "Walter Isaacson"): "Obviously it was named for my daughter."[8]

#### Research and design

The project began in 1978 as an effort to create a more modern version of the then-conventional design epitomized by the [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II "Apple II"). A ten-person team occupied its first dedicated office at 20863 Stevens Creek Boulevard next to the Good Earth restaurant, nicknamed "the Good Earth building".[9] Initial team leader Ken Rothmuller was soon replaced by [John Couch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Couch_(American_executive) "John Couch (American executive)"), under whose direction the project evolved into the "[window-and-mouse-driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing) "WIMP (computing)")" form of its eventual release. [Trip Hawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trip_Hawkins "Trip Hawkins") and [Jef Raskin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin "Jef Raskin") contributed to this change in design.[10]Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs was involved in the concept.

At Xerox's [Palo Alto Research Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company) "PARC (company)"), research had already been underway for several years to create a new humanized way to organize the computer screen, today known as the [desktop metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_metaphor "Desktop metaphor"). Steve Jobs visited Xerox PARC in 1979 and was absorbed and excited by the revolutionary mouse-driven GUI of the [Xerox Alto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto "Xerox Alto"). By late 1979, Jobs successfully negotiated a payment of Apple stock to Xerox, in exchange for his Lisa team receiving two demonstrations of ongoing research projects at Xerox PARC. When the Apple team saw the demonstration of the [Alto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto "Xerox Alto") computer, they were able to see in action the basic elements of what constituted a workable GUI. The Lisa team put a great deal of work into making the graphical interface a mainstream commercial product.

The Lisa was a major project at Apple, which reportedly spent more than $50 million on its development.[11] More than 90 people participated in the design, plus more in the sales and marketing effort, to launch the machine. [_BYTE_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine) "Byte (magazine)")magazine credited [Wayne Rosing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rosing "Wayne Rosing") with being the most important person in the development of the computer's hardware until the machine went into production, at which point he became the technical lead for the entire Lisa project. The hardware development team was headed by Robert Paratore.[12]The industrial design, product design, and mechanical packaging were headed by Bill Dresselhaus, the Principal Product Designer of Lisa, with his team of internal product designers and contract product designers from the firm that eventually became IDEO. [Bruce Daniels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Daniels "Bruce Daniels") was in charge of applications development, and [Larry Tesler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Tesler "Larry Tesler") was in charge of system software.[13] The user interface was designed in six months, after which the hardware, operating system, and applications were all created in parallel.

In 1982, after Steve Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project,[14] he appropriated the existing [Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K "Macintosh 128K") project, which [Jef Raskin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin "Jef Raskin") had conceived in 1979 and led to develop a text-based appliance computer. Jobs redefined Macintosh as a cheaper and more usable Lisa, leading the project in parallel and in secret, and substantially motivated to compete with the Lisa team.

In September 1981, below the announcement of the [IBM PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer "IBM Personal Computer"), _[InfoWorld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfoWorld "InfoWorld")_ reported on Lisa, "McIntosh", and another Apple computer secretly under development "to be ready for release within a year". It described Lisa as having a 68000 processor and 128KB RAM, and "designed to compete with the new [Xerox Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Star "Xerox Star")at a considerably lower price".[15] In May 1982, the magazine reported that "Apple's yet-to-be-announced Lisa 68000 network work station is also widely rumored to have [a mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Mouse#Lisa_Mouse_(A9M0050) "Apple Mouse")."[16] _Apple Confidential_ said, "Finally, and perhaps most damaging, even before the Lisa began shipping in June, the press was full of intentionally-leaked rumors about a fall release of a "baby Lisa" that would work in much the same way, only faster and cheaper. Its name: Macintosh."[3]: 79 

### Launch

Lisa was launched on January 19, 1983.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Its low sales were quickly surpassed by the January 1984 launch of the Macintosh. Newer versions of the Lisa were introduced that addressed its faults and lowered its price considerably, but it failed to achieve sales comparable to the much less expensive Mac. The Macintosh project assimilated a lot more Lisa staff. The final revision, the Lisa 2/10, was modified and sold as the [Macintosh XL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_XL "Macintosh XL").[3]: 79 

### Discontinuation

The high cost and the delays in its release date contributed to the Lisa's discontinuation although it was repackaged and sold at $4,995, as the Lisa 2. In 1986, the entire Lisa platform was discontinued.

In 1987, [Sun Remarketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Remarketing "Sun Remarketing") purchased about 5,000 [Macintosh XLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_XL "Macintosh XL") and upgraded them. In 1989, with the help of Sun Remarketing, Apple disposed of approximately 2,700 unsold Lisa units in a guarded landfill in [Logan, Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan,_Utah "Logan, Utah"), to receive a tax write-off on the unsold inventory.[17] Some leftover Lisa computers and spare parts were available until Cherokee [[Data]] (which purchased Sun Remarketing) went out of business.[_[when?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_]

## Overview

### Hardware

The Lisa was first introduced on January 19, 1983. It is one of the first personal computer systems with a [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical user interface") (GUI) to be sold commercially. It uses a [Motorola 68000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000 "Motorola 68000") [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit "Central processing unit") clocked at 5 MHz and has 1 MB of RAM. It can be upgraded to 2 MB and later shipped with as little as 512 kilobytes. The CPU speed and model were not changed from the release of the Lisa 1 to the repackaging of the hardware as Macintosh XL.

The [real-time clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_clock "Real-time clock") uses a 4-bit integer and the base year is defined as 1980; the software won't accept any value below 1981, so the only valid range is 1981–1995.[18] The real-time clock depends on a 4 × [AA-cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA_battery "AA battery") [NiCd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel%E2%80%93cadmium_battery "Nickel–cadmium battery") pack of batteries that only lasts for a few hours when main power is not present. Prone to failure over time, the battery packs could leak corrosive alkaline [electrolyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte "Electrolyte") and ruin the circuit boards.[18]

The integrated monochrome black-on-white monitor has 720 × 364 rectangular pixels on a 12-inch (30 cm) screen.

Lisa's printer support includes Apple's [Dot Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Dot_Matrix_Printer "Apple Dot Matrix Printer"), [Daisy Wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Daisy_Wheel_Printer "Apple Daisy Wheel Printer"), and [ImageWriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_ImageWriter "Apple ImageWriter")[dot matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_matrix_printing "Dot matrix printing") printers, and [Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_Inc. "Canon Inc.")'s new color [inkjet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkjet_printing "Inkjet printing") technology.

The original Lisa, later called the Lisa 1, has two [Apple FileWare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_FileWare "Apple FileWare") 5.25-inch double-sided variable-speed [floppy disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk "Floppy disk") drives, more commonly known by Apple's [codename](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codename "Codename") "Twiggy".[3]: 77–78  They have what was then a very high capacity of approximately 871 kB each, but are unreliable[3]: 78  and use proprietary diskettes. Competing systems with high diskette [[data]] storage have much larger 8" floppy disks, seen as cumbersome and old-fashioned for a consumer system.

Lisa 1's innovations include [block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(data_storage) "Block (data storage)") sparing, to reserve blocks in case of bad blocks, even on floppy disks.[19] Critical operating system information has [redundant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering) "Redundancy (engineering)") storage, for recovery in case of corruption.

#### Lisa 2

The first hardware revision, the Lisa 2, was released in January 1984 and was priced between US$3,495 and $5,495.[3]: 79 [20] It was much less expensive than the original model, and dropped the Twiggy floppy drives in favor of a single [400K Sony microfloppy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_External_Disk_Drive#400K "Macintosh External Disk Drive").[21] The Lisa 2 has as little as 512 KB of RAM. The **Lisa 2/5** consists of a Lisa 2 bundled with an external 5- or 10-megabyte hard drive.[22] In 1984, at the same time the Macintosh was officially announced, Apple offered free upgrades to the Lisa 2/5 to all Lisa 1 owners, by replacing the pair of Twiggy drives with a single 3.5-inch drive,[21] and updating the boot ROM and I/O ROM. In addition, the Lisa 2's new front faceplate accommodates the reconfigured floppy disk drive, and it includes the new inlaid Apple logo and the first [Snow White design language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White_design_language "Snow White design language") elements. The **Lisa 2/10** has a 10MB internal hard drive, no parallel port, and a standard configuration of 1 MB of RAM.[22]

Developing early Macintosh software required a Lisa 2.[23] There were relatively few third-party hardware offerings for the Lisa, as compared to the earlier [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II "Apple II")—[AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AST_Research "AST Research") offered a 1.5 [MB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabyte "Megabyte") memory board which, when combined with the standard Apple 512 [KB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilobyte "Kilobyte") memory board, expanded the Lisa to a total of 2 MB of memory, the maximum amount that the [MMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit "Memory management unit") can address.

Late in the product life of the Lisa, there were third-party hard disk drives, [SCSI controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI_host_adapter "SCSI host adapter"), and [double-sided 3.5-inch floppy-disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-sided_disk "Double-sided disk") upgrades. Unlike the original Macintosh, the Lisa has expansion slots. The Lisa 2 motherboard has a very basic [backplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backplane "Backplane") with virtually no electronic components, but plenty of [edge connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_connector "Edge connector") sockets and slots. There are two RAM slots, one CPU upgrade slot, and one [I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output "Input/output") slot, all in parallel. At the other end are three Lisa slots in parallel.

#### Macintosh XL

Main article: [Macintosh XL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_XL "Macintosh XL")

In January 1985, following the Macintosh, the Lisa 2/10 (with integrated 10 MB hard drive) was rebranded as Macintosh XL. It was given a hardware and software kit, enabling it to reboot into Macintosh mode and positioning it as Apple's high-end Macintosh. The price was lowered yet again, to $4,000, and sales tripled, but CEO John Sculley said that Apple would have lost money increasing production to meet the new demand.[24] Apple discontinued the Macintosh XL, leaving an eight-month void in Apple's high-end product line until the [Macintosh Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Plus "Macintosh Plus") was introduced in 1986.

### Software

#### Lisa OS

You can help by [adding to it](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apple_Lisa&action=edit&section=).  _(March 2019)_|

The Lisa [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") features [protected memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_protection "Memory protection"),[25] enabled by a crude hardware circuit compared to the [Sun-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-1 "Sun-1") workstation (c. 1982), which features a full memory management unit. [Motorola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola "Motorola") did not have an MMU (memory-management unit) for the [68000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000 "Motorola 68000") ready in time, so third parties developed their own. Apple's is also the result of a cost-cutting compromise, with sluggish performance. Based, in part, on elements from the [Apple III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_III "Apple III") [SOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_SOS "Apple SOS") operating system released three years earlier, Lisa's [disk operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_operating_system "Disk operating system") also organizes its files in hierarchical directories. [File system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system "File system") directories correspond to GUI folders, as with previous Xerox PARC computers from which Lisa borrowed heavily. Lisa was designed around a hard drive, unlike the first Macintosh.

Lisa has two main user modes: the Lisa Office System and the Workshop. The Lisa Office System is the GUI environment for end users. The Workshop is a program development environment and is almost entirely text-based, though it uses a GUI text editor. The Lisa Office System was eventually renamed 7/7 which refers to the seven supplied application programs: LisaWrite, LisaCalc, LisaDraw, LisaGraph, [LisaProject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LisaProject "LisaProject"), LisaList, and LisaTerminal.

Apple's warranty said that this software works precisely as stated, and Apple refunded an unspecified number of users, in full, for their systems. These operating system frailties, and costly recalls, combined with the very high price point, led to the failure of the Lisa in the marketplace. NASA purchased Lisa machines, mainly to use the LisaProject program.

In 2018, the Computer History Museum announced it would be releasing the source code for Lisa OS, following a check by Apple to ensure this would not impact other intellectual property. For copyright reasons, this release does not include the American Heritage dictionary.[26] For its 40th anniversary on January 19, 2023, Lisa OS Software version 3.1's source code is available under an Apple Academic License Agreement.[27][28]

#### MacWorks

Main article: [MacWorks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacWorks "MacWorks")

In April 1984, following the release of the Macintosh, Apple introduced MacWorks, a software emulation environment that allows the Lisa to run Macintosh System software and applications.[29] MacWorks helped make the Lisa more attractive to potential customers, although it did not enable the Macintosh emulation to access the hard disk until September. Initial versions of the Mac OS could not support a hard disk on the Macintosh machines. In January 1985, re-branded MacWorks XL, it became the primary system application designed to turn the Lisa into the [Macintosh XL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_XL "Macintosh XL").

#### Third-party software

A significant impediment to third-party software on the Lisa was the fact that, when first launched, the Lisa Office System could not be used to write programs for itself. A separate development OS, called Lisa Workshop, was required. During this development process, engineers would alternate between the two OSes at startup, writing and compiling code on one OS and testing it on the other. Later, the same Lisa Workshop was used to develop software for the Macintosh. After a few years, a Macintosh-native development system was developed. For most of its lifetime, the Lisa never went beyond the original seven applications that Apple had deemed enough to "do everything",[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]although UniPress Software did offer [UNIX System III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_III "UNIX System III") for $495.[30]

[Santa Cruz Operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz_Operation "Santa Cruz Operation") (SCO) offered [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") [XENIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XENIX "XENIX") (version 3), a [UNIX-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX-like "UNIX-like")[command-line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface "Command-line interface") operating system, for the Lisa 2 — and the [Multiplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplan "Multiplan") spreadsheet (version 2.1) that ran on it.[31]

## Reception

_[BYTE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYTE "BYTE")_ wrote in February 1983 after previewing the Lisa that it was "the most important development in computers in the last five years, easily outpacing [the [IBM PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer "IBM Personal Computer")]". It acknowledged that the $9,995 price was high, and concluded "Apple ... is not unaware that most people would be incredibly interested in a similar but less expensive machine. We'll see what happens".[11]

The Apple Lisa was a commercial failure, the company's largest since the [Apple III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_III "Apple III") of 1980. Apple sold a total of approximately 10,000[1] Lisa machines at US$9,995 (equivalent to about $29,400 in 2022) each,[32] generating total sales of $100 million against a development cost of more than $150 million.[1] The largest Lisa customer was [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA"), which used [LisaProject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LisaProject "LisaProject") for project management.[33]

The Lisa 2 and its [Mac ROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World_ROM "Old World ROM")-enabled [Macintosh XL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_XL "Macintosh XL") version are the final two releases in the Lisa line, which was discontinued in April 1985.[34] The Macintosh XL is a hardware and software conversion kit to effectively reboot Lisa into Macintosh mode. In 1986, Apple offered all Lisa and XL owners the opportunity to return their computer, with an additional payment of US$1,498, in exchange for a [Macintosh Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Plus "Macintosh Plus") and [Hard Disk 20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Disk_20 "Hard Disk 20").[35] Reportedly, 2,700 working but unsold Lisa computers were buried in a landfill.[36]

## Legacy

The [Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K "Macintosh 128K") project, led by Steve Jobs, borrowed heavily from Lisa's GUI paradigm and directly took many of its staff, to create Apple's flagship platform of the next several decades. The [column-based interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_columns "Miller columns"), for instance, utilized by Mac OS X, had originally been developed for Lisa.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] It had been discarded in favor of the icon view.

Apple's culture of [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming") on Lisa contributed to the 1988 conception of [Pink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taligent#Pink_system "Taligent"), the first attempt to re-architect the operating system of Macintosh.
