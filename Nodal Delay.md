## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Nodal delay is the total time a [[data]] packet spends at a network node, including processing, queuing, transmission, and propagation delays.

## OVERVIEW:
Nodal delay refers to the cumulative time a [[data]] packet experiences as it passes through a network node, such as a router or switch. This delay is composed of four primary components: processing delay, queuing delay, [[transmission delay]], and [[propagation delay]]. Processing delay is the time taken by the node to examine the packet's header and determine its destination. Queuing delay occurs when packets wait in a queue before being processed, which can vary based on network traffic and congestion levels. [[Transmission delay]] is the time required to push all the packet's bits onto the network link, dependent on the link's bandwidth. [[Propagation delay]] is the time it takes for the packet to travel from the node to the next destination, determined by the physical distance and the speed of signal transmission. Nodal delay is a critical factor in network performance, affecting the overall latency and quality of service. Minimising nodal delay is essential for ensuring efficient and timely [[data]] transmission, particularly in real-time applications like video conferencing and online gaming.
