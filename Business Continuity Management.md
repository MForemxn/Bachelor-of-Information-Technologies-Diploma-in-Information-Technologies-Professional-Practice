## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY

Business Continuity Management (BCM) is a comprehensive [[process]] aimed at ensuring that critical business functions continue or are restored swiftly in the event of disruptions, such as cyberattacks, hardware failures, or natural disasters.

## MAIN POINTS

### What is Business Continuity Management?

- **Business Continuity Management (BCM)** focuses on maintaining the [[availability]] of critical business functions during and after significant disruptions. This ensures that an organization can continue operating at an acceptable predefined level.
- BCM is proactive and aims to avoid or mitigate risks before they occur.

### Key Components of BCM

1. **Risk Assessment**: Identifying potential threats, vulnerabilities, and their impacts on business operations.
2. **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**: A structured [[process]] for determining critical business [[processes]], required resources, and interdependencies.
    - Identifies the critical [[processes]]/functions and the systems that must recover first in the event of a disruption.
    - Recovery objectives such as **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** and **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** are established.
3. **Strategy Development and Response Plan Documentation**: Outlines specific recovery plans and response actions.
4. **Testing and [[Maintenance]]**: Regular testing and updates of the business continuity plan to ensure its effectiveness.

### Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

- BIA identifies critical [[processes]], supporting resources, and interdependencies.
- Helps quantify the impact of a disruption in financial, legal, or operational terms.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Defines the maximum tolerable [[data]] loss.
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Defines the maximum time allowed for a system to recover.

### Case Studies in BCM

1. **CBA Ransomware Attack**: A ransomware attack encrypted CBA employees' [[data]], demanding a ransom for recovery.
2. **Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) DDoS Attack (2016)**: The ABS website was down for two days, costing over $270 million.
3. **Amazon Outage**: A short outage led to an estimated $5 million in lost revenue, highlighting the importance of rapid recovery.

### Recovery Sites and Resilience Strategies

- **Recovery Sites**:
    - **Cold Site**: Bare infrastructure with long RTO; cheaper.
    - **Warm Site**: Basic infrastructure with moderate RTO; moderate cost.
    - **Hot Site**: Fully operational backup with near-zero RTO; most expensive.
- **Resilience Strategies**:
    - Options like **[[data]] mirroring**, **cloud-based resiliency**, and **electronic [[data]] vaulting** can be used depending on the organization's needs and budget.
    - A cost-benefit analysis should be performed to balance risk, cost, and performance.

### Continuity Plan Testing and Updating

- **Testing**: Plans should be tested regularly using methods like structured walk-throughs, simulations, or full-interruption tests.
- **Updating**: Continuity plans should be updated after significant events or as the organization evolves (e.g., new systems, customers, or compliance requirements).

### Quantifying [[Cybersecurity]] Business Continuity Plan

- BCM performance can be measured by evaluating factors such as efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness.
- Regular reports should be provided to senior management to keep them informed of the BCM program's progress.

## TAKEAWAYS

- A robust BCM plan helps ensure an organization can survive and recover from disruptive incidents.
- Testing and regular updates are critical to maintaining an effective BCM strategy.
- Balancing the cost of BCM strategies with the potential impact of downtime is crucial for effective [[risk management]].
