# [[Security]] Program and Management [[Models]]

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion, you should be able to:
- Define management’s role in the development, [[maintenance]], and enforcement of information [[security]] policy, standards, practices, procedures, and guidelines.
- Describe what an information [[security]] blueprint is, its major components, and how it supports the information [[security]] program.
- Understand how to use blueprints, frameworks, and [[security]] management [[models]] to organize and prioritize [[cybersecurity]] efforts.

## [[Cybersecurity]] Program
A **[[cybersecurity]] program** helps organizations secure assets against cyberattacks and ensure business continuity. It involves creating, operating, managing, and maintaining a suite of effective [[security]] solutions. Key elements include:
- **Policy**
- **Awareness and Training**
- **Program Management**
- **[[Risk Management]]**
- **Incident Handling**
- **Contingency Preparedness**
- **Physical [[Security]] & Access Control**
- **Personnel/User Issues**
- **Audit Trails & [[Cryptography]]**

### Challenges of Running a [[Cybersecurity]] Program
- Developing strategic, tactical, and operational plans.
- Managing information [[security]] controls, such as [[encryption]], policies, procedures, and [[contingency planning]].
- Ensuring compliance with regulations like HIPAA, PCI DSS, and Sarbanes-Oxley.

## Organizing for [[Security]]
Key [[variables]] in structuring a [[cybersecurity]] program include:
- **Organizational Culture**
- **Size of Organization and Available Resources**
- **[[Security]] Personnel Budget**
- **[[Security]] Capital Budget**

### Organizational Culture
A strong [[security]] culture supports larger, well-funded programs, while a poor culture may view [[security]] as a waste of resources.

### Organization Size
Organizations vary from small (10-100 computers) to very large (over 10,000 computers), affecting the structure and resources for [[cybersecurity]]. Larger organizations typically require more support and may have specialized [[cybersecurity]] divisions.

### [[Security]] Budget
Budget allocations for personnel and capital resources often correspond to the size of the organization. Larger organizations typically spend less per user on [[security]].

## [[Security]] in Different Sized Organizations
- **Small Organizations**: Usually have a single location, fewer formal policies, and outsource IT [[security]]. [[Security]] responsibilities often fall on system administrators.
- **Medium-sized Organizations**: Limited [[security]] staff and resources, often leading to inefficient [[security]] management.
- **Large Organizations**: More formalized [[security]], with multiple divisions and [[security]] integrated into company culture.
- **Very Large Organizations**: Well-resourced [[security]] programs with significant budgets and staffing.

## Components of a [[Security]] Program
A good [[security]] program includes:
- **Mission Statement** aligned with organizational goals.
- **Resource Allocation** for achieving [[security]] objectives.
- **Clear Governance** to ensure consistency and measure success.
- **Ethical Obligations** to act in stakeholders’ best interests.

## [[Cybersecurity]] Roles and Titles
[[Cybersecurity]] positions can be classified into:
- **Those that define**: Policy creators, risk assessors, and senior advisors.
- **Those that build**: Technicians who install and maintain [[security]] solutions.
- **Those that administer**: [[Security]] operators and monitors.

Roles include:
- Chief Cyber/Information [[Security]] Officer (CCSO/CISO)
- [[Security]] Managers, Consultants, Administrators, Analysts, and Technicians.

## [[Security]] Management [[Models]]
[[Security]] [[models]] provide a conceptual framework for implementing [[security]] policies. Common [[models]] include:
- **NIST SP 800-X [[Security]] Model**: A public and widely reviewed framework.
- **ISO 27000 Series**: Provides broad guidelines for implementing and maintaining information [[security]].
- **COBIT 5 Framework**: Focuses on IT governance and risk [[reduction]].
- **ITIL**: Formerly known as the Information Technology Infrastructure Library, now ITIL.
- **CIS SANS Top 20**: Critical [[security]] controls for effective defense.

### Developing a [[Cybersecurity]] Blueprint
A **[[cybersecurity]] blueprint** defines the [[security]] architecture and outlines tasks to achieve [[security]] goals. It specifies the order of tasks and [[security]] architecture components like firewalls and intrusion-detection systems.

## Frameworks and Governance
- **[[Security]] Framework**: Supports the development of a complete [[cybersecurity]] management plan and aligns with organizational policies, standards, and guidelines.
- **Cyber/Information [[Security]] Governance Framework**: Provides managerial guidance for developing a [[cybersecurity]] governance structure.

## [[Security]] Architecture [[Models]]
[[Security]] architecture is a framework for specifying [[security]] requirements derived from:
- **Policies**
- **[[Risk Analysis]]**
- **Environmental Analysis**

### Common [[Security]] [[Models]]
- **Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)**: Defines criteria for access control assessments.
- **Information Technology [[Security]] Evaluation Criteria (ITSEC)**: Evaluates the [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], and [[availability]] of systems.
- **Common Criteria (CC)**: An international standard for [[security]] certification.

### Access Control [[Models]]
Access control [[models]] define how systems control access to objects by [[subjects]] (users, [[processes]]). Common [[models]] include:
- **Mandatory Access Controls (MACs)**: Control is dictated by the system, not the user.
- **Discretionary Access Controls (DACs)**: The owner sets the access permissions.

### [[Data]] Classification [[Models]]
[[Data]] classification helps organizations manage information by assigning [[security]] levels such as public, sensitive, confidential, or top secret.

## Summary
- A **[[Security]] Management Program** contains efforts to manage risks to an organization’s information assets.
- **[[Security]] [[Models]]** specify [[security]] policies and best practices.
- A **Blueprint** identifies necessary [[security]] controls, while a **Framework** outlines the design and [[implementation]] of those controls.
