# Where is Unix Used
- used since 1969
- used on most of the computers which run the internet (background)
- MacOS and iOS are based on unix
	- so are android phones
- versions
	- AT&T research 
- uses heaps of different scripting languages, even within one operating system
- POSIX tried to normalise everything
	- 1990's linux wars was caused by this
	- 2002 Single Unix Specification (SUS) was created 
	- then came IBM VM/CMS
# Why has it survived?
- it's just an idea, which means that no one can own it
	- anyone who wants to use it can
- unix is based on simple concepts
	- even hardware are classes as files
- it's portable
	- can be used on phones and laptops
- it's free
- efficient, stable, and relatively safe

# What is UNIX?
- UNIX is a powerful, multi-user, and multitasking operating system originally developed in the 1970s by AT&T Bell Labs.
- It is designed to be portable, multi-tasking, and multi-user in a time-sharing configuration.
- UNIX systems are known for their robustness, scalability, and flexibility.

# History of UNIX
- Initially developed in 1969 by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others at AT&T's Bell Labs.
- It was written in assembly language but was later rewritten in C by Dennis Ritchie, which significantly increased its portability across different hardware platforms.
- Over the years, UNIX has evolved through various versions and has inspired the creation of numerous UNIX-like [[operating systems]], such as Linux and BSD.

# UNIX Architecture
- The UNIX operating system architecture is layered and includes the following components from lowest to highest:
	- Hardware (CPU, memory, I/O devices)
	- Kernel (core part of the OS, manages hardware resources, process and memory management)
		- Manages file systems, networking, and system calls
		- Acts as an interface between hardware and user applications
	- Shell (command-line interface or [[CLI]])
		- Allows users to interact with the kernel through commands
	- Utilities and Applications
		- User-level programs and tools for file manipulation, text editing, programming, and communication

# Features of UNIX
- Multi-user capability: Allows multiple users to access the system and its resources simultaneously.
- Multi-tasking: Enables several programs to run at the same time.
- Pipe and filter architecture: Allows the output of one program to serve as the input to another, facilitating complex data processing workflows.
- Hierarchical file system: Organizes files in a tree-like structure, making it easier to manage and navigate.
- Scripting and programming support: Comes with powerful scripting languages like shell scripting, AWK, and sed, and supports various programming languages.

# UNIX Derivatives
- UNIX has led to the development of various derivatives and UNIX-like [[operating systems]], including:
	- [[BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)]]: A version of UNIX developed at the University of California, Berkeley.
	- [[System V]]: A version of UNIX developed by AT&T.
	- Linux: Although not derived from UNIX's codebase, it is UNIX-like in its design and functionality.
	- macOS: Apple's operating system for Mac computers, based on the BSD variant of UNIX.

# Impact of UNIX
- UNIX and its concepts have had a profound impact on the development of other [[operating systems]] and the field of computing as a whole.
- Its design principles, such as "everything is a file" and the use of simple, composable tools, have influenced the design of many subsequent [[operating systems]].
- The POSIX standard was developed to ensure compatibility among UNIX and UNIX-like [[operating systems]], promoting interoperability and standards across different platforms.
