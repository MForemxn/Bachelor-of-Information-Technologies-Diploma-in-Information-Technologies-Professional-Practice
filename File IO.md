# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:  
File I/O in [[Swift]] involves reading from and writing to files, enabling [[data]] persistence and retrieval through efficient file handling mechanisms.

# OVERVIEW:  
File I/O ([[Input]]/[[Output]]) in [[Swift]] is a crucial aspect of application development, allowing programs to read from and write to files for [[data]] persistence and retrieval. [[Swift]] provides several APIs and classes, such as FileManager, [[Data]], and [[String]], to facilitate file operations. FileManager is used for handling file system operations like creating, deleting, and moving files or directories. The [[Data]] and [[String]] classes enable reading and writing file contents in various formats, including text and binary. [[Swift]]'s file I/O operations are designed to be safe and efficient, leveraging [[error handling]] mechanisms to manage potential issues during file access. By using these tools, developers can ensure their applications can store and retrieve [[data]] reliably, supporting features like user preferences, [[data]] caching, and document management.
