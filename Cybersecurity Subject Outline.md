This subject equips you with vital [[cybersecurity]] skills, addressing the dual aspects of people management and technology to mitigate risks like legal repercussions, financial losses, and eroded trust. You'll develop a robust understanding of cyber-attacks, defense mechanisms, and security services—[[confidentiality]], integrity, availability. You'll also gain hands-on experience with industry-standard technologies such as IPSec, SSL, PGP, and S/MIME. Through practical application, you'll be prepared to enhance the [[cybersecurity]] posture of contemporary organisations.

This subject will be delivered as a series of workshops, interactive lectures and lab sessions. The subject relies heavily on UTS Canvas, therefore students are expected to check UTS Canvas regularly to access materials and weekly activities.

Workshops will be interactive and hold discussions on important topics. Lecture notes are supported by PowerPoint slides, learning materials and strategies described in the Learning Guide. _All workshops and lectures will be recorded and will be available to students after the activities in CANVAS. Students are required to read the lecture materials before the workshops in order to understand the concepts clearly. During the workshop sessions a range of questions will be discussed, linking them to the lecture contents, and helping to focus on topics that students have found most challenging. Also, during the workshop sessions, students will be invited to discuss or present their ideas._ All materials given in the subject readings are examinable, even those not directly presented or discussed in lectures. Students will gain most from the class time by reading each week's preparation material in advance and clarifying any questions during the interactive workshop sessions, student consultation times and lab discussion times.

During each week's lab session, students will perform a set of provided tasks. The tasks are closely related to the week's lecture topic. There will be discussion sessions during the lab where the lab instructor will pose questions related to the lab activities and students will work either individually or in groups to answer the questions by performing hands-on activities, engaging in group discussions, as well as looking through Internet resources.

Students are expected to attend and participate in all lab activities, contribute to online discussions, complete assignments by their due dates and actively participate in groups for the group-based activities both in and out of class time. An average student aiming to pass the subject is expected to invest 9-10 learning hours each session week for this subject.

The subject will be delivered as a 1.5 hour interactive lecture, followed by a 1.5 hour laboratory session.
