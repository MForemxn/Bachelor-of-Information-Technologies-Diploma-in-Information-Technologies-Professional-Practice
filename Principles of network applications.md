## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Network applications rely on principles like client-server architecture, protocols, [[scalability]], [[security]], and reliability to facilitate communication and [[data]] exchange over networks.

## OVERVIEW:
Network applications are designed to enable communication and [[data]] exchange over computer networks, such as [[the internet]]. These applications operate based on several core principles. The client-server architecture is fundamental, where clients request services and servers provide them. Protocols, such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP, define the rules for [[data]] transmission, ensuring interoperability between different systems. [[Scalability]] is crucial for handling increasing loads and expanding user bases without performance degradation. [[Security]] measures, including [[encryption]], [[authentication]], and [[authorisation]], protect [[data]] and ensure privacy. Reliability ensures consistent and dependable service, often achieved through redundancy and fault tolerance. These principles collectively ensure that network applications are efficient, secure, and capable of meeting user demands.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Client-server architecture underpins network applications.
2. Protocols define rules for [[data]] transmission.
3. [[Scalability]] handles increasing loads and user bases.
4. [[Security]] measures protect [[data]] and ensure privacy.
5. Reliability ensures consistent and dependable service.
6. [[Encryption]] safeguards [[data]] during transmission.
7. [[Authentication]] verifies user identities.
8. [[Authorisation]] controls access to resources.
9. Redundancy and fault tolerance enhance reliability.
10. Interoperability ensures systems can work together.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Client-server architecture is fundamental to network applications.
2. Protocols ensure proper [[data]] transmission and system interoperability.
3. [[Scalability]] and reliability are crucial for performance and service consistency.
4. [[Security]] measures like [[encryption]], [[authentication]], and [[authorisation]] protect [[data]].
5. Redundancy and fault tolerance improve application reliability.
