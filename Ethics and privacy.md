# Ethics:
## The principles of right and wrong that individuals use to make choices that guide their behaviour.
### It is not always easy to decide what is right or wrong. However, the available frameworks can [[help]] us make ethical decisions.
# Fundamental Tenets of Ethics:
- **Responsibility**: means that you accept the consequences of your decisions and actions.
- **[[Accountability]]**: refers to determining who is responsible for actions that were taken.
- **Liability**: A legal concept that gives individuals the right to recover the  damages done to them by other individuals, organisations, or  systems

> What is Unethical is not necessarily Illegal

# Ethical Frameworks
## [[Utilitarian approach]]
- An ethical action is the one that provides the most good or does the least harm for all affected parties.
## [[Rights approach]]
- An ethical action is the one that best protects and  respects the moral rights of the affected parties.
## [[Common good approach]]
- An ethical action is the one that best serves the community as a whole, not just some members.
### Utility vs Rights
|Framework|Priority|Choice|Justification|
|---|---|---|--|
|Utility|Prioritizes the greatest good for the greatest number|Would choose Option A, laying off 50 employees, as it maximizes overall well-being and minimizes harm|This approach saves the company, benefits the remaining employees, and avoids a larger financial burden|
|Rights|Prioritizes individual rights and dignity|Would choose Option B, implementing a pay cut, as it respects the rights and dignity of all employees, avoiding harm and unfair treatment|This approach recognizes the moral duty to protect employees' rights and dignity, even if it means sharing the burden|
# What are Ethics and Privacy?
- Ethics and privacy are intertwined concepts, especially in the digital age. 
- Ethics refers to the moral principles that govern a person's behaviour or the conducting of an activity. 
- Privacy, on the other hand, is the right of individuals to keep their personal information secure and free from unauthorized access.
- In the context of technology and the internet, these concepts become crucial as they address how personal information is collected, used, and shared.
# Ethical issues: From programing perspective
## Recognise an ethical issue
- Could this [[decision]] or situation damage someone or some group?
- Does this [[decision]] involve a choice between a good and bad alternative?
- Does this issue involve more than legal considerations? If so, in what way?
## Get the facts
- What are the relevant facts of the situation?
- Do I know enough to make a [[decision]]?
- Which individuals and/or groups have an important stake in the outcome?
- Have I consulted all relevant persons and groups?
## Evaluate alternative actions under all four ethical standards
- Which option will produce the best and has the least harm? (the [[utilitarian approach]])
- Which option best respects the rights of all stakeholders? (the [[rights approach]])
- Which option best serves the community as a whole and not just some members? (the common good  approach)
## Make a [[decision]] and test it
- Which approach best addresses the situation?
- Act and reflect on the outcome of your [[decision]]
- How can I implement my [[decision]] with the greatest care and attention to the concerns of all stakeholders?
- How did my [[decision]] turn out, and what did I learn from this specific situation?
## Four General Categories of Ethical Issues Related to IT:
- Privacy issues
	- Privacy issues involve collecting, storing, and disseminating information about individuals.
	- ![[Pasted image 20240513110037.png]]
- Accuracy issues
	- Accuracy issues involve the authenticity, fidelity, and correctness of the information that is collected and processed.
	- ![[Pasted image 20240513110048.png]]
- Property issues
	- Property issues involve the ownership and value of information.
	- ![[Pasted image 20240513110058.png]]
- Accessibility issues
	- Accessibility issues revolve around who should have access to  information and whether a fee should be paid for this access
	- ![[Pasted image 20240513110115.png]]
# Privacy
- In general, privacy is the right to be left alone and to be free of unreasonable personal intrusions.
- Information privacy is the right to determine when, and to what extent, information about you can be gathered and/or communicated to others. Privacy rights apply to individuals, groups, and institutions.
- Privacy can be interpreted quite broadly. However, court decisions in many countries have followed this rule fairly closely:
- The right of privacy is not absolute. Privacy must be balanced against the needs of society.
- This illustrates why determining and enforcing privacy regulations can be difficult.
## Electronic Surveillance
- Tracking people’s activities with the aid of information technology has become a major privacy-related problem.
- Electronic surveillance, is rapidly increasing, particularly with the emergence of new technologies.
- Electronic surveillance is conducted by employers, the government, and other institutions.
### Facial Recognition Technology
- Another example of how new devices can contribute to electronic surveillance is facial recognition technology. Just a few years ago, this software worked only in very controlled settings such as passport checkpoints.
- However, this technology can now match faces even in regular snapshots and online images. For example, Intel and Microsoft have introduced in-store digital billboards that can recognise your face. These billboards can keep track of the products you are interested in based on your purchases or browsing behaviour.
- A car dealer can take a picture of you when you step onto the car lot.
	- He or she could then quickly profile you (find out information about where you live, your employment, etc.) on the Web to gain a competitive edge in making a sale.
# The Importance of Ethics in Technology
- With the rapid advancement of technology, ethical considerations are more important than ever.
- Technology can greatly benefit society, but it also has the potential to harm individuals if used irresponsibly.
- Ethical guidelines in technology aim to ensure that advancements contribute positively to society without infringing on individuals' rights or well-being.
- Issues such as [[data]] breaches, surveillance, and the manipulation of information highlight the need for ethical standards in technological development and [[implementation]].
# Privacy Law
- Privacy law relates to the protection of an individual’s personal [[data]] and  information
- The Privacy Act regulates how personal information is handled
- The Privacy Act allows you to:
	- know why your personal information is being collected, how it will be used and who it will be disclosed to
	- ask for access to your records (including your health information)
	- stop receiving unwanted direct marketing material
	- correct inaccurate information about you
	- make a complaint about an agency or organisation, if you think that they have mishandled your personal information.
# Privacy Codes and Policies
- Privacy policies or privacy codes are an organization’s guidelines for protecting the privacy of its customers, clients, and employees.
- Privacy laws revolve around requirements that mandate that organizations get users to opt-in or opt-out of specific [[data]] collection and processing activities.
- The opt-out model of informed consent permits the company to collect personal information until the customer specifically requests that the [[data]] not be collected.
- The opt-in model of informed consent, which prohibits an organization from collecting any personal information unless the customer specifically authorizes it.
## [[Data]] Collection

# Personal Information in Databases
There are several concerns about the information you provide to these record keepers. Some of the major concerns are:
- Do you know where the records are?
- Are the records accurate?
- Can you change inaccurate [[data]]?
- How long will it take to make a change?
- Under what circumstances will personal [[data]] be released?
- How are the [[data]] used?
- To whom are the [[data]] given or sold?
- How secure are the [[data]] against access by unauthorised people?
# Privacy Concerns in the Digital Age
- The digital age has brought about unprecedented levels of [[data]] collection and surveillance.
- Personal information is constantly being collected by various entities, from social media platforms to government agencies.
- This raises significant privacy concerns, as individuals often have little control over what information is collected and how it is used.
- The potential for misuse of personal [[data]] is a major ethical issue, with implications for individual autonomy, [[security]], and freedom.

# Balancing Innovation and Privacy
- One of the key challenges in technology ethics is finding the right balance between innovation and privacy.
- Technological advancements can offer significant benefits, such as improved healthcare, enhanced [[security]], and greater convenience.
- However, these advancements should not come at the expense of individuals' privacy rights.
- Ethical frameworks and regulations are needed to ensure that technology serves the public good while respecting personal privacy.

# The Role of Legislation and Regulation
- Legislation and regulation play a critical role in protecting ethics and privacy in the digital world.
- Laws such as the General [[Data Protection]] Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union set standards for [[data protection]] and privacy.
- These regulations require organizations to be transparent about [[data]] collection practices and give individuals control over their personal information.
- However, the rapid pace of technological change often outstrips the ability of legislation to keep up, highlighting the need for ongoing vigilance and adaptation.

# Ethical Design and Development
- Ethical considerations should be integrated into the design and development of technology.
- This involves thinking about the potential impacts of technology on society and individuals from the outset.
- Principles such as transparency, consent, and respect for user privacy should guide the development process.
- By prioritizing ethics and privacy, developers can create technology that is not only innovative but also responsible and user-centric.

# The Future of Ethics and Privacy
- As technology continues to evolve, so too will the ethical and privacy challenges it presents.
- The future of ethics and privacy in technology will likely involve ongoing debates about the balance between innovation and individual rights.
- Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and the [[Internet of Things]] will raise new ethical questions, requiring thoughtful consideration and proactive measures.
- Ultimately, the goal is to create a digital world that respects and protects the rights and dignity of all individuals.
