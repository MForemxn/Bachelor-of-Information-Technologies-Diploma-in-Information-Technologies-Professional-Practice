## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Technical controls in cybersecurity address technical and tactical issues by implementing preventative, detective, and responsive measures to secure an organisation.

## OVERVIEW:
Technical controls in cybersecurity are essential for addressing the technical and tactical aspects of designing and implementing security measures within an organisation. These controls are categorised into three main types: preventative, detective, and responsive. Preventative controls aim to stop security incidents before they occur by implementing measures such as firewalls, encryption, and access controls. Detective controls are designed to identify and alert on security incidents as they happen, using tools like intrusion detection systems (IDS), security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and continuous monitoring. Responsive controls focus on mitigating the impact of security incidents after they have occurred, involving actions such as incident response, forensics, and patch management. Together, these technical controls form a comprehensive approach to securing an organisation's information systems, ensuring that threats are effectively managed and mitigated.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Technical controls address technical and tactical security issues.
2. Preventative controls stop incidents before they occur.
3. Detective controls identify and alert on incidents in real-time.
4. Responsive controls mitigate the impact of incidents post-occurrence.
5. Firewalls, encryption, and access controls are examples of preventative measures.
6. IDS, SIEM, and continuous monitoring are examples of detective measures.
7. Incident response, forensics, and patch management are examples of responsive measures.
8. Comprehensive technical controls ensure effective threat management.
9. Essential for designing and implementing organisational security.
