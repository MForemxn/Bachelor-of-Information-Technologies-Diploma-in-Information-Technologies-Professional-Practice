## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Entities are distinct objects or concepts within a system that have unique [[attributes]] and are crucial for [[data]] organisation and management.

## OVERVIEW:
Entities are fundamental components in [[data]] [[Requirements Modelling]] and [[database]] design, representing distinct objects, concepts, or things within a system that have unique [[attributes]]. Each entity is characterised by a set of properties or [[attributes]] that describe it, such as a customer having a name, address, and contact information. Entities are used to organise and structure [[data]], making it easier to manage, query, and analyse. In relational databases, entities are typically represented as tables, with each row corresponding to a unique instance of the entity and each column representing an attribute. Entities can also have relationships with other entities, which are defined through [[keys]] and constraints, enabling complex [[data]] interactions and [[integrity]]. Proper [[identification]] and definition of entities are crucial for effective [[database]] design, ensuring that the system accurately reflects the real-world scenarios it is intended to model.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Represent distinct objects or concepts in a system.
2. Characterised by unique [[attributes]].
3. Essential for [[data]] organisation and management.
4. Used in [[data]] [[Requirements Modelling]] and [[database]] design.
5. Represented as tables in relational databases.
6. Rows correspond to unique instances of entities.
7. Columns represent [[attributes]] of entities.
8. Entities can have relationships with other entities.
9. Relationships defined through [[keys]] and constraints.
10. Accurate entity definition ensures effective [[database]] design.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Entities are key components in [[data]] [[Requirements Modelling]].
2. Unique [[attributes]] define each entity.
3. Proper entity definition is crucial for [[database]] accuracy.
4. Relationships between entities enable complex [[data]] interactions.
5. Effective entity management enhances [[data]] organisation and analysis.
