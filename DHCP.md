# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
A DHCP server automatically assigns IP addresses and network configuration settings to devices on a network, simplifying network management.

# OVERVIEW:
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used to automate the [[process]] of configuring devices on IP networks. A DHCP server dynamically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration parameters, such as subnet masks, default gateways, and [[DNS]] servers, to client devices, allowing them to communicate on the network. This automation reduces the need for manual configuration, minimizing errors and simplifying network administration. DHCP servers can be standalone devices or integrated into routers and switches. They maintain a pool of available IP addresses and lease them to devices for a specified period. When a device connects to the network, it sends a DHCP request, and the server responds with the necessary configuration details. DHCP is essential for managing large networks efficiently, ensuring devices can join and leave the network seamlessly without IP conflicts.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. DHCP automates [[IP address]] assignment.
2. Reduces manual configuration and errors.
3. Assigns subnet masks, gateways, and [[DNS]] settings.
4. Can be standalone or integrated into routers.
5. Maintains a pool of available IP addresses.
6. Leases IP addresses for a specified period.
7. Devices request configuration upon network connection.
8. Essential for efficient large network management.
9. Prevents [[IP address]] conflicts.
10. Simplifies network administration and [[scalability]].

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. DHCP servers automate network configuration.
2. They reduce manual setup and potential errors.
3. Essential for managing large, dynamic networks.
4. Prevents IP conflicts and simplifies administration.
5. Integrated into many network devices for convenience.
