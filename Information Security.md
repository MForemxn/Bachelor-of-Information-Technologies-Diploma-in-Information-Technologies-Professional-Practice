# What is Information [[Security]]?

- Information [[security]] encompasses all [[processes]] and policies designed to protect an organisation's information and its [[information systems]] (IS) from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
- It aims to safeguard the [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], and [[availability]] of data, while ensuring the continuous functionality of [[information systems]].

# Detailed Explanation of Information [[Security]] Threats

- **Internal Threats:** Originate from individuals or events within a company. These can be either intentional, such as acts of sabotage, or unintentional, like human errors.
- **External Threats:** Come from outside the organisation and include cyberterrorism, cyberwarfare, and hacking attempts.
- **Vulnerabilities:** Refer to weaknesses in an organisation's systems or [[security]] policies that can be exploited to cause harm. Common vulnerabilities include inadequate [[security]] controls and policies.

# Types of Information [[Security]] Safeguards and Controls

- **Physical Controls:** Measures to physically secure data, such as locks and secure access to buildings.
- **Access Controls:** Techniques to ensure that only authorized individuals can access certain data or [[information systems]].
- **Communication Controls:** Include firewalls, [[encryption]], and anti-malware systems, which protect the data as it moves across networks.

# Information [[Security]] [[Processes]]

- **[[Risk Management]]:** Involves identifying, controlling, and minimizing the impact of threats, and consists of risk analysis, [[risk mitigation]], and controls evaluation.
- **[[Risk Analysis]]:** Assessing the value of each asset, estimating the likelihood of compromise, and comparing the potential costs of an asset being compromised against the cost of protecting it.
- **[[Risk Mitigation]]:** Implementing controls to prevent threats and developing recovery strategies if a threat materializes.

# Specific Software Attacks

- **Remote Attacks:** Can occur with or without user action and involve malicious software designed to infect computers.
- **Phishing and Spear Phishing:** Techniques used by attackers to deceive users into providing sensitive information, which can then be used for fraudulent activities.

# Social Engineering

- Social engineering involves manipulating or deceiving people into divulging confidential information. It relies on human interaction and often involves tricking other people to break normal [[security]] procedures.

# Case Study: Small Businesses in Danger

- The case study emphasizes the importance of implementing basic [[security]] controls in small businesses, such as regular updates to anti-virus software and backing up data.
- It stresses the critical need for robust backup plans and procedures to safeguard against data loss, which can be time-consuming and costly to recover.
