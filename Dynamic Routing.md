# [[Static Routing]] vs Dynamic Routing

||Dynamic Routing|[[Static Routing]]|
|---|---|---|
|**Configuration Complexity**|Generally independent of the network size|Increases with network size|
|**Topology Changes**|Automatically adapts to topology changes|Administrator intervention required|
|**Scaling**|Suitable for simple and complex topologies|Suitable for simple topologies|
|**[[Security]]**|Less Secure|More Secure|
|**Resource Usage**|Uses CPU, Memory, Link bandwidth|No extra resources needed|
|**Predictability**|Route depends on the current topology|Route to destination is always the same|
