## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Intrusion detection technology identifies and responds to suspicious activities within a network to prevent [[security]] breaches and [[data]] loss.

## OVERVIEW:
Intrusion detection technology is a critical component of [[cybersecurity]], designed to detect unauthorised access or abnormal activities within a network. It operates by continuously monitoring network traffic, system activities, and user behaviours to identify potential threats. There are two main types of intrusion detection systems ([[IDS]]): Network-based [[IDS]] (NIDS) and Host-based [[IDS]] (HIDS). NIDS monitors network traffic for suspicious patterns, while HIDS focuses on individual devices. [[IDS]] can be passive, alerting administrators to potential threats, or active, taking automatic actions to mitigate risks. Advanced [[IDS]] utilise [[machine learning]] and behavioural analysis to improve detection accuracy. By identifying threats early, intrusion detection technology helps organisations respond swiftly to potential [[security]] incidents, thereby minimising damage and ensuring the [[integrity]] and [[confidentiality]] of [[data]].

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Detects unauthorised access and abnormal activities.
2. Monitors network traffic and system activities.
3. Two main types: Network-based and Host-based.
4. Network-based [[IDS]] monitors network traffic.
5. Host-based [[IDS]] focuses on individual devices.
6. Can be passive or active.
7. Passive [[IDS]] alerts administrators to threats.
8. Active [[IDS]] takes automatic actions.
9. Utilises [[machine learning]] for improved accuracy.
10. Helps organisations respond swiftly to threats.

## TAKEAWAYS:
1. Intrusion detection is vital for [[cybersecurity]].
2. Early threat [[identification]] minimises damage.
3. Network-based and Host-based [[IDS]] serve different purposes.
4. [[Machine learning]] enhances detection capabilities.
5. Active [[IDS]] can automatically mitigate risks.
