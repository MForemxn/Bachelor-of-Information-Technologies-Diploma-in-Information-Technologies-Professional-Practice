# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
X.509 certificates are a standard format for [[digital certificates]], providing a framework for public key infrastructure and secure communications.

# OVERVIEW:
X.509 is a widely used standard for [[digital certificates]], which are essential components of [[public key infrastructure (PKI)]]. These certificates are used to verify the identity of [[entities]] and facilitate secure communications over networks. An X.509 certificate contains information such as the certificate holder's public key, the certificate's serial number, the issuer's details, and the certificate's validity period. It also includes a digital signature from the issuing Certificate Authority (CA), which ensures the certificate's authenticity and [[integrity]]. X.509 certificates are crucial for establishing secure connections in various applications, including SSL/TLS for secure web browsing, email [[encryption]], and VPNs. They support a hierarchical trust model, where trust is established through a chain of certificates leading back to a trusted root CA. This standard ensures interoperability and [[security]] across different systems and platforms.
