# Subject coordinator

Darryl Veitch

Email: darryl.veitch@uts.edu.au

The Subject Coordinator may be contacted by email if you have matters of a personal nature to discuss, e.g., illness,
study problems, etc.

All email must have the prefix [31268] in the subject along with a meaningful description e.g., [31268] request for late
submission due to illness, etc. Any other email will be filtered as spam. The StudentID must be quoted in all
communications. The Lab ID when relevant should also be quoted.

Generally questions regarding assessment and the Subject should be raised on the discussion threads in the Ed systems,
or in the labs/tutorials. This ensures that all students get the benefit of the information given. Issues such as missed
tutorial/labs should first be raised directly with the tutor, not the Subject Coordinator.

A detailed description of how contact with staff should work is given on Canvas.

# Subject description

This subject is an introduction to information technology using the web as a core case study. Students learn about the
underlying hardware, software, networks and [[operating systems]] behind websites and set up a functional website using this
knowledge. **Subject learning objectives (SLOs)**

Upon successful completion of this subject students should be able to:

1. Demonstrate understanding of the basic concepts of hardware, software, [[cybersecurity]], [[processes]] and the components of
an Operating System including how to work on the command line and create simple scripts. (D.1)

2. Identify and explain the role and function of the Internet, the World Wide Web, and their components. Describe and
make use of distributed applications on the Internet. (D.1)

3. Design and implement a simple web site to a given specification. (C.1)

# Course intended learning outcomes (CILOs)

This subject also contributes specifically to the development of the following Course Intended Learning Outcomes (
CILOs): Design Oriented: FEIT graduates apply problem solving, design and [[decision]]-making methodologies to develop
components, systems and [[processes]] to meet specified requirements. (C.1)

Technically Proficient: FEIT graduates apply [[abstraction]], mathematics and discipline fundamentals, software, tools and
techniques to evaluate, implement and operate systems. (D.1)

# Teaching and learning strategies

The theory component will use a mix of formal seminars, online lectures, electronic media, computer based training
system and tutorial based activities. Online lectures and materials such as e-readings must viewed before each week's
tutorials. The tutorials are combined with laboratories and will provide an opportunity for students to tie the theory
taught with practice. Students will collaborate in groups in the tutorial to present and critique on related topics.
Students will use problem based learning in the laboratories to learn about Linux and the web. The major assignment will
require an exploration of web based topics outside of the formally taught content such as aesthetics and accessibility
issues.

# Moderation of marks

The web site assignment is peer reviewed by students. The tutors and subject coordinator will moderate these reviews
after the peer review period has finished.

# Assessment [[feedback]]

Students receive [[feedback]] on their understanding of the role of an Operating System and simple web site construction
through low stakes exercises completed in the Linux computer-based tutorials. These exercises provide live hints and
immediate [[feedback]] as students complete each question which prepares them to develop a web site in assessment 4

# Examination material or equipment

You are allowed to bring a non-programmable calculator for the Quiz 2 and the final exam. Smartphone calculators such as
Android or iPhones will not be allowed. Calculators with binary/hex number conversion or [[boolean logic]] functions are not
allowed. The typical HSC school calculator is a good choice to bring.

You are allowed to bring 1 A4 double sided sheet of notes into the Linux Skills Test. You are allowed to bring in 2 x A4
double sided sheets of notes into the final Theory exam.

**Minimum requirements**

In order to pass the subject, a student must achieve an overall mark of 50% or more.

**U:PASS**

UTS Peer Assisted Study Success is a voluntary “study session” where you will be studying the subject with other
students in a group. It is led by a student who has previously achieved a distinction or high distinction in the subject
area, and who has a good WAM. Leaders will prepare activities for you to work on in groups based on the content you are
learning in lectures and tutorials. It’s really relaxed, friendly, and informal. Because the leader is a student just
like you, they understand what it’s like to study the subject and how to do well, and they can pass those tips along to
you. Students also say it’s a great way to meet new people and a “guaranteed study hour”.

You can find out how to sign up for U:PASS sessions via the U:PASS
website [www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/upass](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/upass/upass/join-session).
Participation is voluntary and only students who want to go should sign up.

If you have any questions or concerns about U:PASS, please contact Georgina at upass@uts.edu.au, or check out
the [website](http://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/upass/upass).

# Assessment: faculty procedures and advice

**Marking criteria**

Marking criteria for each assessment task will be available on the Learning Management
System: [Canvas](https://canvas.uts.edu.au/).

**Extensions**

When, due to extenuating circumstances, you are unable to submit or present an assessment task on time, please contact
your subject coordinator before the assessment task is due to discuss an extension. Extensions may be granted up to a
maximum of 5 days (120 hours) for standard students or up to a maximum of 7 days (168 hours)
for [UTS Online students](https://www.uts.edu.au/utsonline-extension-form). In all cases you should have extensions
confirmed in writing.

**Special consideration**

If you believe your performance in an assessment item or exam has been adversely affected by circumstances beyond your
control, such as a serious illness, loss or bereavement, hardship, trauma, or exceptional employment demands, you may be
eligible to apply
for [Special Consideration](http://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/managing-your-course/classes-and-assessment/special-circumstances/special).

**Late penalty**

For Graded [[subjects]]:

Work submitted late without an approved extension is subject to a late penalty of 10 per cent of the total available
marks deducted per calendar day that the assessment is overdue (e.g. if an assignment is out of 40 marks, and is
submitted (up to) 24 hours after the deadline without an extension, the student will have four marks deducted from their
awarded mark). Work submitted after five calendar days is not accepted and a mark of zero is awarded.

For some assessment tasks a late penalty may not be appropriate – these are clearly indicated in the subject outline.
Such assessments receive a mark of zero if not completed by/on the specified date. Examples include: a. weekly online
tests or laboratory work worth a small proportion of the subject mark, or

b. online quizzes where answers are released to students on completion, or

c. professional assessment tasks, where the intention is to create an authentic assessment that has an absolute
submission date, or d. take-[[home]] papers that are assessed during a defined time period, or

e. pass/fail assessment tasks.

For Pass/Fail [[subjects]]:

Work submitted late without an approved extension will only be assessed at the subject coordinator’s discretion.
Students who do not submit assessment tasks by the due dates may be referred to the Responsible Academic Officer
under [Student Rule 3.8.2](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/rules/uts-student-rules/section-3), and a fail
result may be recorded for the subject.

Request a review of a result

If you believe an error may have been made in the calculation of your result in an assessment task or the final result
for the subject, it is possible
to [request a review of a result](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/managing-your-course/classes-and-assessment/results/request-review-result)
with the Subject Coordinator within five (5) working days of the date of release of the result.

# [[Academic integrity]]

[[Academic integrity]] is about demonstrating honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility in your studies and
assessments.

Studying at UTS and being part of our community means maintaining these values and acting with [[academic integrity]] at all

**Guide to practising [[academic integrity]]**

As a UTS student, when you create something original, credit others and collaborate with care, you act with academic
[[integrity]]: Create something original. This means doing all your own work from start to finish, submitting work that is
original for that assessment and being honest about any [[data]] or results.

Credit others. You need to acknowledge and reference the source of any ideas, [[data]] or materials you use or adapt in your
work. Collaborate with care. Make sure you do group work according to the guidelines from your tutor, lecturer or
supervisor, study with your classmates and friends with care and keep your assessment and study notes just for you.

If you are feeling confused about [[academic integrity]], it’s okay, just ask! We are here to [[help]] you understand academic
[[integrity]] and do your assessments with confidence:

[Explore the guide to practising [[academic integrity]]](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/academic-support/academic-integrity),
including dos and
don’ts. [Complete the [[academic integrity]] self-paced tutorial and quiz](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/academic-support/academic-integrity/tutorial-and-quiz).

[Get [[help]] with academic skills, such as writing, researching and referencing, and other support](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/academic-support/academic-integrity/academic-help)
for life outside of the classroom.

Talk to your tutor, lecturer, subject coordinator
or [UTS [[help]] services](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/academic-support/academic-integrity/academic-help)
if you are unsure about anything [[academic integrity]] related.

**Generative [[AI]] (GenAI) and [[academic integrity]]**

In the Faculty of Engineering and IT [[subjects]], unless otherwise instructed by the Subject Coordinator, you are permitted
to use [[AI]] technologies, such as ChatGPT or DALL-E, to generate materials for background research and self-study. Only
assistive use is permitted. Content generated by [[AI]] technologies or other sources presented as your own work is
considered to be academic misconduct as per
the [UTS Student Rules on misconduct](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/rules/uts-student-rules/section-16).

There are a few things you must do to ensure you are maintaining [[academic integrity]]:

Check the rules for if and how you can use GenAI in your [[subjects]] and assessments via this subject outline or your
subject sites in Canvas (rules will differ between [[subjects]], so make sure you check each subject). If you are not sure,
check with your tutor, lecturer or subject coordinator.

Understand [how to use GenAI ethically](https://studyguides.lib.uts.edu.au/genai/home).

Unless instructed otherwise by the Subject
Coordinator, [reference and acknowledge](https://studyguides.lib.uts.edu.au/genai/referencing) the use of GenAI in your
work, providing details of the type of interactions and extent of usage.

**[[Academic integrity]] breaches**

A breach of [[academic integrity]] is also known as 'academic misconduct'. A breach occurs if you engage in behaviour that
undermines [[academic integrity]], such as plagiarism and cheating (
see [Student Rule 16.2](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/rules/uts-student-rules/section-16)).

Plagiarism can take a number of forms including but not limited to:

copying any section of text, no matter how brief, from a book, journal, article or other written source, such as coding,
without duly acknowledging the source. copying any map, diagram, table or figure without duly acknowledging the source.
paraphrasing or otherwise using the ideas of another author without duly acknowledging the source. re-using sections of
verbatim text without using quote marks to indicate the text was copied from the source (even if a reference is given).

Cheating includes, but is not limited to:

submitting work that is not your own, copying from another student, recycling another student's work, recycling
previously submitted work, and working with another student in the same cohort in a manner that exceeds the boundaries
of legitimate cooperation purchasing an assignment from a website and submitting it as original work. requesting or
paying someone else to write original work, such as an assignment, essay or computer program, and submitting it as
original work. manipulating an assessment to avoid the UTS detection software or using a third-party service to bypass
the UTS detection software. using material or equipment that is not specified on an examination paper for use in the
examination.

Students who allow their assessment to be copied, share their assessment on external platforms, or provide other
students with the answers to assessments are also subject to student misconduct Rules.

These are all serious forms of misconduct
and [penalties apply](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/academic-support/academic-[[integrity]]/consequences-plagiarism-and-cheating).

To [[help]] ensure [[academic integrity]], assessments that you submit electronically may be subject to similarity detection
software. Your work must be submitted in a format able to be assessed by the software (e.g. doc, pdf ([[text files]]), rtf,
html). Under
the [Coursework](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/policies/uts-policy/coursework-assessments-policy) [Assessments Policy](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/uts-governance/policies/uts-policy/coursework-assessments-policy) (
section 4.27), vivas or other invigilated tasks may be used to confirm or clarify your work and/or marks, and to verify
achievement of learning outcomes.

# Academic liaison officer

[Academic liaison officers](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/students-with-accessibility-requirements/accessibility-service/services-and-assistance/academic-liaison-officers-alos/alo-list) (
ALOs) are academic staff in each faculty who assist students experiencing difficulties in their studies due to:
disability and/or an ongoing health condition; carer responsibilities (e.g. being a primary carer for small children or
a family member with a disability); and pregnancy.

ALOs are responsible for approving adjustments to assessment arrangements for students in these categories. Students who
require adjustments due to disability and/or an ongoing health condition are requested to discuss their situation with
an accessibility consultant at
the [Accessibility Service](https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/students-with-accessibility-requirements/accessibility-service)
before speaking to the relevant ALO.
