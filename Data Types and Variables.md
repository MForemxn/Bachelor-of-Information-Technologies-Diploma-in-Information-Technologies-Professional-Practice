# [[Variables]]
### ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
[[Data types]] and [[variables]] are fundamental concepts in programming, defining the nature of data and how it's stored and manipulated.

### MAIN POINTS:
1. [[Variables]] are named storage locations that hold data which can change during program execution.
2. [[Data types]] specify the kind of data a variable can hold, such as integers, floats, and strings.
3. Strongly typed languages require explicit declaration of variable [[data types]].
4. Dynamically typed languages infer [[data types]] at runtime, allowing more [[flexibility]].
5. Common primitive [[data types]] include [[integer]], [[float]], [[boolean]], and [[char]].
6. Complex [[data types]], like arrays and objects, can hold multiple values or a collection of data.
7. [[Type conversion]] allows changing a variable's data type, either implicitly or explicitly.
8. Constants are similar to [[variables]] but hold values that cannot be changed.
9. Scope defines where a variable is accessible within the code, such as local or [[global scope]].
10. Understanding [[data types]] and [[variables]] is crucial for [[data manipulation]] and [[control flow]] in programming.

### TAKEAWAYS:
1. Correctly using [[data types]] and [[variables]] is essential for efficient and error-free programming.
2. The choice between strongly and dynamically typed languages affects how [[variables]] and [[data types]] are handled.
3. Primitive [[data types]] form the building blocks for more complex [[data manipulation]].
4. Knowing when and how to use [[type conversion]] is important for [[data processing]] and [[output]].
5. The scope of [[variables]] significantly impacts program structure and data accessibility.
