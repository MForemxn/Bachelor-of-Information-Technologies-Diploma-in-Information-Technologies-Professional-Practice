## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Multiplexing is a technique that combines multiple signals into one medium to optimise the use of resources and improve efficiency.

## OVERVIEW:
Multiplexing is a method used in telecommunications and computer networks to combine multiple signals or [[data]] streams into a single transmission medium. This technique maximises the use of available bandwidth, allowing for more efficient [[data]] transmission. There are several types of multiplexing, including [[Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)]], [[Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)]], and Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM). Each type has its own specific applications and advantages. TDM divides the time into slots and assigns each signal a specific time slot, while FDM allocates different frequency bands to each signal. WDM, commonly used in fibre optic communications, assigns different wavelengths to each signal. Multiplexing is crucial in modern communication systems, enabling the simultaneous transmission of multiple signals over a single channel, thus reducing the need for multiple physical connections and lowering costs.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Combines multiple signals into one transmission medium.
2. Maximises the use of available bandwidth.
