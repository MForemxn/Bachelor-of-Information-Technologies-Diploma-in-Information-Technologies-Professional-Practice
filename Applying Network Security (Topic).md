# Understanding Network [[Security]]
- network [[security]] involves implementing measures to protect the [[integrity]], [[confidentiality]], and accessibility of computer networks and [[data]]
- it encompasses both hardware and software technologies
- effective network [[security]] manages access to the network and targets a variety of threats to stop them from entering or spreading on the network

# Key Components of Network [[Security]]
- network [[security]] is a broad term that covers a multitude of technologies, devices, and [[processes]]. It's fundamentally about:
	- **Firewalls**: act as a barrier between your trusted internal network and untrusted outside networks
	- **Antivirus and Anti-malware Software**: protects against malicious software threats
	- **Intrusion Prevention Systems ([[IPS]])**: examines network traffic to prevent vulnerability exploits
	- **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**: provide secure [[remote access]] to the network
	- **[[Data]] Loss Prevention (DLP)**: ensures users do not send sensitive information outside the network

# Strategies for Applying Network [[Security]]
- applying network [[security]] effectively requires a multi-layered approach, often referred to as "defense in depth":
	- **Access Control**: only allow authorised users and devices access to network resources
	- **Application [[Security]]**: secure all software and devices used by the network
	- **Behavioural Analytics**: detect abnormal network behaviour to identify threats
	- **Email [[Security]]**: protect the organisation from phishing, spam, and other threats carried by email
	- **Mobile Device [[Security]]**: secure personal and corporate mobile devices to protect the network

# Challenges in Network [[Security]]
- as technology evolves, so do the challenges in network [[security]]:
	- **Sophisticated Cyber Threats**: hackers are constantly developing new methods to exploit networks
	- **IoT Devices**: the increasing number of connected devices presents new [[security]] challenges
	- **Insider Threats**: sometimes the threat comes from within the organisation
	- **Compliance**: adhering to regulatory requirements can be complex and challenging

# Best Practices for Network [[Security]]
- to effectively apply network [[security]], organisations should follow these best practices:
	- **Regularly [[Update and Patch]] Systems**: keep all systems and software up-to-date to protect against vulnerabilities
	- **Educate Employees**: conduct regular training on [[security]] awareness and best practices
	- **Implement Strong Password Policies**: use complex passwords and consider multi-factor [[authentication]]
	- **Regularly [[Backup Data]]**: ensure [[data]] is backed up and can be restored in case of a [[security]] breach
	- **Conduct Regular [[Security]] Audits**: assess the network for vulnerabilities and address them promptly

# The Future of Network [[Security]]
- the future of network [[security]] will likely involve:
	- **[[AI]] and Machine Learning**: to predict and identify new threats more quickly
	- **Increased Use of [[Encryption]]**: to protect [[data]] in transit and at rest
	- **Zero Trust [[Models]]**: assuming no entity inside or outside the network is trustworthy without verification
- as threats evolve, so will the strategies and technologies to combat them, making network [[security]] an ever-changing field.
