## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Packet switching and [[circuit switching]] are two methods of [[data]] transmission, with packet switching dividing [[data]] into packets and [[circuit switching]] establishing a dedicated path.

## OVERVIEW:
Packet switching and [[circuit switching]] are fundamental techniques used in telecommunications to transmit [[data]]. Packet switching involves breaking down [[data]] into smaller packets that are sent independently over the network and reassembled at the destination. This method is highly efficient, as it allows multiple communications to share the same network resources, leading to better utilisation and [[flexibility]]. It is the backbone of [[the internet]] and is used in technologies like VoIP and online gaming. [[Circuit switching]], on the other hand, establishes a dedicated communication path between the sender and receiver for the duration of the session. This method ensures a [[constant]] and reliable connection, making it ideal for traditional voice calls and real-time applications where consistent quality is crucial. However, it is less efficient in terms of resource utilisation compared to packet switching. Understanding the differences between these two methods is essential for designing and managing modern communication networks.

## MAIN POINTS:
1. Packet switching divides [[data]] into smaller packets.
