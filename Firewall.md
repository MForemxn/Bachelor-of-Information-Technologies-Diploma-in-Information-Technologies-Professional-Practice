## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
A firewall is a network [[security]] device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined [[security]] rules.

## OVERVIEW:
A firewall acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as [[the internet]]. It is designed to prevent unauthorised access while permitting legitimate communication. Firewalls can be hardware-based, software-based, or a combination of both. They work by filtering traffic based on a set of [[security]] rules, which can be customised to meet the specific needs of an organisation. Firewalls can block [[data]] from certain locations, applications, or ports while allowing relevant and safe [[data]] through. They are essential for protecting sensitive information and maintaining the [[integrity]] of internal networks. Modern firewalls also offer advanced features such as intrusion detection and prevention, virtual private network (VPN) support, and deep packet inspection.
