# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is an advanced distance-vector routing protocol that offers efficient, scalable, and reliable network routing.

# OVERVIEW:
Enhanced Interior Gateway [[Routing]] Protocol (EIGRP) is a Cisco proprietary advanced distance-vector [[routing]] protocol designed to improve upon the limitations of traditional protocols like [[RIP]]. EIGRP combines the benefits of distance-vector and link-[[state]] protocols, providing fast convergence, [[scalability]], and efficient use of network resources. It uses a composite metric based on bandwidth, delay, load, and reliability to determine the best path for [[data]] packets. EIGRP maintains a topology table that stores multiple routes to each destination, allowing for rapid failover and route recalculation. It employs the Diffusing Update [[Algorithm]] (DUAL) to ensure loop-free and efficient [[routing]] decisions. EIGRP supports classless [[routing]], variable-length [[subnet]] masking ([[VLSM]]), and route summarization, making it suitable for complex and large-scale networks. Its ease of configuration and robust performance make EIGRP a popular choice for enterprise networks seeking a balance between simplicity and advanced [[routing]] capabilities.
